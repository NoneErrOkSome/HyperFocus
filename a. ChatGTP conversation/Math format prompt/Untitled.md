To improve the prompt, consider the following enhancements for clarity and completeness:

---

**Title: Guidelines for Formatting Mathematical Expressions**

**Instructions:**

1. **Inline Math Format**: Use single dollar signs `$...$` to encapsulate inline mathematical expressions. This ensures that the expression is seamlessly integrated within a line of text. For example, to display an equation like \(E = mc^2\) within a sentence, format it as `$E = mc^2$`.

2. **Block Math Format**: Use double dollar signs `$$...$$` to encapsulate mathematical expressions that should appear on a new line or as standalone blocks. This is useful for larger equations that require emphasis or more space. For instance, to display a standalone equation:
   $$
   E = mc^2
   $$

3. **Avoid Backslashes for Delimiting Math Expressions**: Do not use backslashes such as `\(...\)` or `\[...\]` for opening and closing math expressions. Stick to using dollar signs as specified above.

This version provides clear examples and context for each guideline, making it easier for users to understand how to apply them correctly.
