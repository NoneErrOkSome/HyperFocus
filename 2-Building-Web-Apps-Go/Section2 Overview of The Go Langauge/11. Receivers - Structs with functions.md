Here’s an extraction of the key concepts from the instructor’s exact words, along with code examples and additional clarifications:

---

### **Key Concepts: Structs and Methods in Go**

**1. Structs Can Have Functions Associated with Them**

**Instructor's Words:**
"But there's another thing you need to know about them, and that is that structs can actually have functions associated with them."

**Clarification:**
In Go, when you associate a function with a struct, it is known as a **method**. Methods allow structs to have behavior in addition to data. This is done by defining functions with a receiver of the struct type.

---

**2. Defining a Struct**

**Instructor's Words:**
"So let's first of all create a struct. We'll create a type that is a struct and I'll call it `type myStruct` of type `struct` and we'll give its definition, and it's going to have one field in it, and the field is going to be called `FirstName` and it's of type `string`. So I've now created that type."

**Code Example:**
```go
type myStruct struct {
    FirstName string
}
```

**Clarification:**
- Here, we define a new struct type named `myStruct` with one field `FirstName` of type `string`.
- Structs in Go are used to group together data fields.

---

**3. Creating Variables of the Struct Type**

**Instructor's Words:**
"So now I can create a variable of that type, and we'll create one `var`, we'll call the `var` `myVar`, it's of type `myStruct`. So I've created an empty variable..."

**Code Example:**
```go
var myVar myStruct
```

**Clarification:**
- We declare a variable `myVar` of type `myStruct`.
- At this point, `myVar` is an instance of `myStruct` with default zero values for its fields.

---

**4. Assigning Values to Struct Fields**

**Instructor's Words:**
"...and now I can assign something to `FirstName` just by going `myVar.FirstName = "John"`. And that's easy enough."

**Code Example:**
```go
myVar.FirstName = "John"
```

**Clarification:**
- We assign the value `"John"` to the `FirstName` field of `myVar`.
- Fields of a struct are accessed using the dot `.` notation.

---

**5. Using Shorthand to Create and Initialize Struct Variables**

**Instructor's Words:**
"And as you know, I can also create a second variable... but I can do it also using shorthand. I can just say `myVar2` is assigned the value of... it's going to be of type `myStruct`, and we'll just fill out `FirstName`. We'll do it all in one step, create the variable and assign values to its members in one step. And this is a very common shorthand."

**Code Example:**
```go
myVar2 := myStruct{
    FirstName: "Mary",
}
```

**Clarification:**
- We use the shorthand `:=` to declare and initialize `myVar2` in one line.
- The struct literal allows us to set field values upon creation.

---

**6. Printing Struct Field Values**

**Instructor's Words:**
"So let's just print some information out. `log.Println("myVar is set to", myVar.FirstName)` and then I can duplicate that line and say `myVar2` is set to `myVar2.FirstName`. Now that I've used `myVar2`, the error goes away."

**Code Example:**
```go
log.Println("myVar is set to", myVar.FirstName)
log.Println("myVar2 is set to", myVar2.FirstName)
```

**Clarification:**
- We print the values of the `FirstName` field for both `myVar` and `myVar2`.
- Using `log.Println` outputs the message to the console with a timestamp.

---

**7. Defining a Method on a Struct**

**Instructor's Words:**
"But I can assign a function to this struct and I can do that really easily. So let's first of all create a new function. `func` defines a function, but rather than just giving the function name... if I put right after the `func` keyword in parentheses some variable name and then a pointer to the struct in question, `myStruct`. Now I have access to this variable, and what this does, this is called a **receiver**, and it ties this function to the type of `myStruct` because I'm using `*myStruct` here..."

**Code Example:**
```go
func (m *myStruct) printFirstName() string {
    return m.FirstName
}
```

**Clarification:**
- We define a method `printFirstName` with a receiver `(m *myStruct)`.
- The receiver `m` is a pointer to an instance of `myStruct`, allowing the method to access the struct's fields.
- This method returns the `FirstName` field of the struct.

---

**8. Using the Struct Method**

**Instructor's Words:**
"So I can say `myVar.printFirstName()` and `myVar2.printFirstName()`. So I'm calling a function that's part of this struct."

**Code Example:**
```go
log.Println("myVar is set to", myVar.printFirstName())
log.Println("myVar2 is set to", myVar2.printFirstName())
```

**Clarification:**
- We call the `printFirstName` method on instances `myVar` and `myVar2`.
- This demonstrates how methods are called on struct instances using dot notation.

---

**9. Benefits of Using Methods with Structs**

**Instructor's Words:**
"Now, the good thing about this of course, is that this function can be far more complex than merely returning the value of a given member. You can perform some business logic in here and have that business logic actually become part of this struct, and that is exceptionally useful, and we'll be using that regularly throughout the remainder of this course."

**Clarification:**
- Methods can encapsulate behavior related to the struct's data.
- You can include validation, formatting, or any logic needed before returning or modifying data.
- This promotes better organization and code reuse.

---

### **Complete Code Example:**

```go
package main

import "log"

type myStruct struct {
    FirstName string
}

// Method associated with myStruct
func (m *myStruct) printFirstName() string {
    return m.FirstName
}

func main() {
    // Create an instance of myStruct and assign a value
    var myVar myStruct
    myVar.FirstName = "John"

    // Create and initialize another instance using shorthand
    myVar2 := myStruct{
        FirstName: "Mary",
    }

    // Call the method on both instances
    log.Println("myVar is set to", myVar.printFirstName())
    log.Println("myVar2 is set to", myVar2.printFirstName())
}
```

**Output:**
```
YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS myVar is set to John
YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS myVar2 is set to Mary
```
*(Note: The timestamp will vary based on when you run the program.)*

### **Additional Clarifications:**

- **Methods in Go:**
  - In Go, a method is a function with a special receiver argument.
  - The receiver `(m *myStruct)` specifies that the method `printFirstName` is associated with the `myStruct` type.
  - Methods can be defined for any type, not just structs.

- **Pointer Receivers:**
  - Using a pointer receiver `*myStruct` means that the method can modify the original struct data.
  - If you use a value receiver (without `*`), the method operates on a copy of the struct.

- **Benefits of Methods:**
  - Methods allow you to define behaviors that are relevant to the data the struct holds.
  - They help in organizing code and making it more readable and maintainable.
  - Encapsulating logic within methods promotes data integrity and abstraction.

- **Why Use Methods Instead of Direct Field Access:**
  - **Encapsulation:** Methods can control access to the struct's fields, enforcing rules or validations.
  - **Abstraction:** You can change the underlying implementation without affecting code that uses the struct.
  - **Reusability:** Common operations on the struct can be reused wherever the struct is used.

- **Example of Adding Business Logic to a Method:**
  ```go
  func (m *myStruct) formattedFirstName() string {
      // Business logic: capitalize the first letter
      if len(m.FirstName) == 0 {
          return ""
      }
      return strings.ToUpper(string(m.FirstName[0])) + m.FirstName[1:]
  }
  ```
  - This method adds logic to format the first name before returning it.
