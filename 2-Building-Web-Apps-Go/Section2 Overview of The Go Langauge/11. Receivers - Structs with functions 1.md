Let's improve the example with more meaningful names and context. Instead of talking about arbitrary names like `myStruct`, `myVar`, or `printFirstName`, let's use something that reflects a real-world scenario, like managing an employee in a company. The struct could represent an employee, and the method attached to the struct could return the full name of the employee. Here's the updated code with better naming:

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
)

// Employee represents a struct for an employee's basic information.
type Employee struct {
	FirstName string
	LastName  string
}

// FullName is a method that returns the full name of the employee.
func (e *Employee) FullName() string {
	return e.FirstName + " " + e.LastName
}

func main() {
	// Creating an employee using the Employee struct
	employee1 := Employee{
		FirstName: "John",
		LastName:  "Doe",
	}

	// Creating another employee
	employee2 := Employee{
		FirstName: "Jane",
		LastName:  "Smith",
	}

	// Log the full names of both employees by calling the FullName method.
	log.Println("Employee 1 Full Name:", employee1.FullName())
	log.Println("Employee 2 Full Name:", employee2.FullName())
}
```

### Key Points:

- **Employee Struct**: Represents a real-world entity, like an employee, with fields `FirstName` and `LastName`.
- **FullName Method**: A method that returns the employee's full name by combining the first and last name. This is more meaningful as it's something you might need in a real application.
- **Practical Example**: The struct and method are used in a real-world way, making it easier to understand how methods attached to structs can be useful for handling objects.

This approach keeps the same principles but makes them more relatable and easier to grasp in a real-world scenario.
