Yes, you can set Git Bash as the default terminal in Visual Studio Code. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Open VS Code Settings**:
   - Go to **File** > **Preferences** > **Settings** or press `Ctrl + ,` (on Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + ,` (on Mac).

2. **Search for Terminal Settings**:
   - In the settings search bar, type `terminal integrated shell`.

3. **Set the Default Shell to Git Bash**:
   - You’ll see several options for different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
   - Under the **Terminal > Integrated > Default Profile: Windows** (if you're on Windows), select **Edit in settings.json**.
   
   You can also manually edit your `settings.json`:

   - Add the following line for Git Bash:

     ```json
     "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows": "Git Bash"
     ```

4. **Ensure Git Bash is Installed**:
   - To confirm that Git Bash is available as an option, you can check the **Terminal > Integrated > Profiles: Windows** setting in VS Code and make sure "Git Bash" is listed. If it’s not listed, you may need to add it manually or ensure Git Bash is installed.

   If it's not installed yet, you can download it from [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/).

5. **Verify the Change**:
   - After making this change, open a new terminal in VS Code (using `Ctrl + ` or navigating to **Terminal > New Terminal**) and it should automatically open Git Bash.

Now, Git Bash should be your default terminal every time you open a new terminal window in Visual Studio Code.
