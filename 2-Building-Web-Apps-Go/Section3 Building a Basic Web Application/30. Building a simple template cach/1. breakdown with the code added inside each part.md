Here is the breakdown with the code added inside each part:

### Part 1: **Inefficient Template Rendering**  
**Instructor's words**:  
Currently, the function `render template` reads files from disk every time someone visits a page. It reads the layout file and the actual template, then parses and stores them in a variable called `parsed template`. This is not very efficient, as we're reading from disk on every request.

**Clarification**:  
Reading from disk is a slow process compared to retrieving data from memory. Every time the page is rendered, reading from disk for the template and layout increases the time it takes to serve the request. This process can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially if the site handles many visitors. A more efficient method would involve caching the templates, so they only need to be read and parsed once.

**Code Example**:

```go
func RenderTemplate(w http.ResponseWriter, tmpl string) {
    parsedTemplate, err := template.ParseFiles("./templates/" + tmpl, "./templates/base.layout.tmpl")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error parsing template:", err)
        return
    }
    err = parsedTemplate.Execute(w, nil)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error executing template:", err)
    }
}
```

### Part 2: **Improving Efficiency with Two Approaches**  
**Instructor's words**:  
To improve this, I'm going to show two different approaches: one that's relatively simple and one that's a bit more complex. If you're new to programming, you'll probably want to stick with the first approach. If you have some experience, you might be interested in the second approach, which we’ll cover later. The first approach is easier to get started with, while the second might be better in the long run.

**Clarification**:  
The first approach focuses on implementing a simple caching mechanism, which allows templates to be loaded and reused efficiently. The second approach will be more advanced, but also more automated and scalable, which could make it better for larger or more complex applications. The simpler approach is easy to implement, but requires manually managing templates, while the more complex one might involve dynamically managing templates.

### Part 3: **Creating a New Function to Render Templates**  
**Instructor's words**:  
I’m going to create a new function called `renderTemplateTest` (to avoid naming conflicts), which takes two variables: the response writer (which writes to the browser) and the template name (a string). For now, the function doesn't return anything.

**Clarification**:  
This function is responsible for rendering the template and sending the resulting HTML back to the client. The response writer (`http.ResponseWriter`) is used to send the data, while the template name is provided as a string. Initially, the function is set up to handle rendering, but it doesn't yet implement caching or error handling. It's a starting point for implementing a more efficient rendering process by improving how templates are handled.

**Code Example**:

```go
func renderTemplateTest(w http.ResponseWriter, tmpl string) {
    // This function doesn't return anything for now
    var parsedTemplate *template.Template
    var err error
}
```

---

### Part 4: **Using a Data Structure to Store Parsed Templates**  
**Instructor's words**:  
Instead of reading from disk every single time, I’m going to create a data structure to store the parsed templates. Then, I’ll check if the template already exists in that data structure. If it does, I’ll use the cached version. If not, I’ll read it from disk, parse it, and store the result in the data structure. A map is the best data structure for this.

**Clarification**:  
A **map** in Go is a key-value data structure that allows quick lookups. Here, the key will be the template name (a string), and the value will be the parsed template. This approach avoids repeatedly accessing the disk, which is slow. By storing templates in memory, you can drastically speed up subsequent requests for the same template. The map acts as a **cache** where the program checks if the template is already available; if not, it reads and stores it for future use.

**Code Example**:

```go
var tc = make(map[string]*template.Template) // Template cache as a map
```

---

### Part 5: **Making the Template Cache Accessible Globally**  
**Instructor's words**:  
The map that stores the cached templates needs to be accessible every time we call the `renderTemplateTest` function. So, instead of declaring the variable inside the function, I’ll make it a package-level variable, which is accessible across the package. I’ll name it `tc` for template cache, and it will be a map with a string key (for the template name) and a pointer to a template.

**Clarification**:  
By making the template cache a package-level variable, the cache is persistent and available across all functions within the package. This means that once a template is cached, any part of the package can access it without having to reinitialize or reload it. The map is declared outside the function, ensuring its lifespan matches that of the program, allowing cached templates to be reused across multiple requests.

**Code Example**:

```go
var tc = make(map[string]*template.Template) // Template cache
```

---

### Part 6: **Checking if a Template is in the Cache**  
**Instructor's words**:  
To check if the template is already in the map, I can use Go’s built-in feature for map lookups. I’ll retrieve two values: the actual template (which I’ll ignore with the underscore `_`), and a boolean called `inMap` that indicates if the template exists in the map. If `inMap` is `false`, that means the template isn't in the cache, so I’ll read it from disk and parse it. If `inMap` is `true`, the template is already cached, and I can use it directly.

**Clarification**:  
Go provides an easy way to check if a key exists in a map. By using the **comma-ok idiom**, you can quickly see whether the requested template is already cached. If the template is not in the cache, the code will proceed to load it from disk and store it in the cache. If the template is in the cache, it avoids disk access altogether, improving performance by retrieving it directly from memory.

**Code Example**:

```go
_, inMap := tc[tmpl]
if !inMap {
    // Template not in cache, need to load and parse it
} else {
    // Template is in cache
}
```

---

### Part 7: **Logging the Cache Status**  
**Instructor's words**:  
If the template is already in the cache, I’ll write a log message saying "using cached template." If the template isn’t in the cache, I’ll log "creating template and adding to cache." These logs will help track what’s happening behind the scenes when rendering pages.

**Clarification**:  
Logging is an important debugging tool. By printing messages to the console, you can see whether the program is using a cached template or reading and parsing it from disk. This gives visibility into how the caching system is working and helps troubleshoot potential issues. Logging makes it easier to understand the behavior of the application, especially in production environments where performance is critical.

**Code Example**:

```go
if !inMap {
    log.Println("creating template and adding to cache")
} else {
    log.Println("using cached template")
}
```

---

### Part 8: **Creating the Template if Not Cached**  
**Instructor's words**:  
If the template isn’t in the cache, I’ll need to read it from disk, parse it, and store it in the cache. Once the template is successfully created, I’ll store it in the map using the template name as the key and the parsed template as the value.

**Clarification**:  
When a template is not found in the cache, the program reads the template file from the disk and parses it using Go’s `template.ParseFiles()` function. This process converts the template into a usable format for rendering. After parsing, the template is added to the cache, allowing it to be reused on subsequent requests without reloading it from disk. This process ensures that each template is only read and parsed once, speeding up future accesses.

**Code Example**:

```go
tmpl, err := template.ParseFiles("./templates/" + tmpl, "./templates/base.layout.tmpl")
if err != nil {
    log.Println(err)
    return
}
tc[tmpl] = tmpl // Store the parsed template in the cache
```

---

### Part 9: **Executing the Template**  
**Instructor's words**:  
Once the template is either retrieved from the cache or created, I can then execute the template using the `Execute` method. This method takes the response writer (`w`) and any data (in this case, `nil`) to populate the template. The result is sent to the user's browser.

**Clarification**:  
Executing the template is the final step in rendering it. The `Execute` method combines the template with any dynamic data (if provided) and writes the resulting HTML to the browser through the `http.ResponseWriter`. In this example, no dynamic data is passed, so the template itself is rendered as-is. This method ensures that the server response is sent correctly to the client after caching or reading the template.

**Code Example**:

```go
err = tmpl.Execute(w, nil)
if err != nil {
    log.Println(err)
}
```

---

### Part 10: **Creating a Function to Cache Templates**  
**Instructor's words**:  
To make things easier, I’ll create a separate function called `createTemplateCache` that handles reading and

 parsing the template. This function takes the template name as a parameter, constructs the full path to the file, and then reads it along with the layout. Once both files are parsed, the function stores the resulting template in the cache. If any error occurs during this process, it returns the error, otherwise it adds the template to the cache and returns `nil`.

**Clarification**:  
Separating the logic for reading and caching templates into its own function (`createTemplateCache`) improves the code’s readability and reusability. By doing this, the logic to handle templates is encapsulated in one place, making it easier to manage and update in the future. The function returns an error if something goes wrong (e.g., the file doesn’t exist or can’t be parsed), allowing the main function to handle that error appropriately. This ensures templates are only cached when successfully read and parsed.

**Code Example**:

```go
func createTemplateCache(tmpl string) error {
    templates := []string{
        "./templates/" + tmpl,
        "./templates/base.layout.tmpl",
    }

    tmpl, err := template.ParseFiles(templates...)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    tc[tmpl] = tmpl
    return nil
}
```
