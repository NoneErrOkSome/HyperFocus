Not exactly. Let me clarify:

In Go, when you use the **comma-ok** idiom (`value, ok := map[key]`), you are retrieving both the value and a boolean `ok` that indicates whether the key exists in the map. 

However, if you don't need the **value** but only want to check if the key exists (i.e., if `ok` is `true` or `false`), you can use an **underscore (`_`)** to ignore the value.

### Example:
```go
_, inMap := templateCache[t]
```

Here:
- `templateCache[t]` looks for the key `t` in the `templateCache` map.
- `_` is used to **ignore** the actual value associated with the key `t`. In this case, you're not interested in the value, just whether the key exists.
- `inMap` is a boolean that will be `true` if the key `t` exists in the map, and `false` otherwise.

### Does This Mean Skipping the Key or Value?
In this scenario:
- You are **not skipping the key**. You are still looking up the key `t` in the map. 
- What you're **skipping** is the **value** associated with the key by using the underscore (`_`), because you don't need the value in this case.

### Example With Full Key-Value:
If you wanted to get both the value and check if the key exists, you would use:

```go
value, inMap := templateCache[t]
if inMap {
    fmt.Println("Value:", value) // Do something with the value if key exists
}
```

In this case, you're retrieving both the **value** and checking if the key exists (`inMap` is `true` or `false`).

### Summary:
- **You are not skipping the key.** The key is always necessary to look up an entry in a map.
- **You can skip the value** by using the underscore (`_`) if you only want to check whether the key exists.
