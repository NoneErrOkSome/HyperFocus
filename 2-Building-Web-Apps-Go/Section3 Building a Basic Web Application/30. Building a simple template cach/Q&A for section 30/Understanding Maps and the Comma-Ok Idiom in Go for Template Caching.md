Let's break it down step by step, starting from the **basics of maps** in Go, and then leading to the specific line of code you are asking about.

### 1. **Basic Map in Go**
A map in Go is a data structure that allows you to store key-value pairs. The **key** is used to look up a corresponding **value**.

For example:
```go
myMap := make(map[string]int)  // A map where the key is a string and the value is an int
myMap["age"] = 25              // Key is "age", and the value is 25
```

Here:
- `"age"` is the **key**.
- `25` is the **value** associated with that key.

If you want to access the value of `"age"`:
```go
ageValue := myMap["age"]
fmt.Println(ageValue)  // Output: 25
```

### 2. **Checking if a Key Exists in a Map**
Go has a special way to check if a key exists in the map, called the **comma-ok idiom**. When you access a map using a key, Go returns two values:
1. The value associated with the key.
2. A boolean (`true` or `false`) indicating whether the key exists in the map.

For example:
```go
value, ok := myMap["age"]  // "age" is the key
if ok {
    fmt.Println("Value:", value)  // Value: 25
} else {
    fmt.Println("Key does not exist")
}
```
Here:
- `value` is the value associated with the key.
- `ok` is `true` if the key exists, and `false` if it doesn't.

### 3. **Underscore (`_`) in Go**
In Go, the **underscore** (`_`) is used to ignore values that you don't need. In the example above, if you donâ€™t care about the value and just want to check whether the key exists, you can use an underscore for the value:
```go
_, ok := myMap["age"]  // We ignore the actual value and only care about whether the key exists
if ok {
    fmt.Println("Key exists")
} else {
    fmt.Println("Key does not exist")
}
```

### 4. **Now Applying it to Your Code:**
In your code, the line:
```go
_, inMap := templateCache[gohtml]
```

- **`gohtml`** is the key used to look up a value in the `templateCache` map.
- The map `templateCache` is defined as `map[string]*template.Template`, meaning:
  - **Key**: `string` (the name of the template, e.g., `gohtml`).
  - **Value**: A parsed Go template (`*template.Template`).

### Let's break this line down:
- **`templateCache[gohtml]`**: You are checking if the key `gohtml` (which is a string) exists in the `templateCache` map.
- **`_`**: You don't care about the actual value (the template itself), so you ignore it using `_`.
- **`inMap`**: This is a boolean value (`true` or `false`) that tells you whether the key `gohtml` exists in the map.

#### Putting it All Together:
In this line:
```go
_, inMap := templateCache[gohtml]
```
- You are checking if the **key** `gohtml` exists in the map `templateCache`.
- You don't care about the actual template (the **value**), so you ignore it with `_`.
- The boolean `inMap` will be `true` if the key exists, and `false` if it doesn't.

This is a typical use of Go's **comma-ok idiom** to check for the existence of a key in a map.
