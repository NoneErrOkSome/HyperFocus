The main difference between `log.Println()` and `fmt.Println()` (and their related functions, `log.Print()` and `fmt.Print()`) is their intended use and how they handle output. Here’s a breakdown:

### 1. **Purpose**:
   - **`fmt.Println()`**: It is primarily used for general-purpose output, such as printing messages to the console in both development and production environments. It's often used when displaying output to the user.
   - **`log.Println()`**: This is specifically used for logging information about the program's execution. It is used for system or diagnostic messages, such as errors, warnings, and status updates during the program's execution.

### 2. **Output Destination**:
   - **`fmt.Println()`**: By default, it prints to the standard output (`os.Stdout`), which is typically the console or terminal.
   - **`log.Println()`**: It also prints to the standard output by default, but it includes additional features for logging, like automatically printing the date and time with each message. This makes `log.Println()` more suitable for tracking events in production environments or debugging.

### 3. **Logging Features**:
   - **`log.Println()`**:
     - It automatically prefixes log messages with the date and time when the log was generated, which is useful for debugging and tracing.
     - It can be configured to log messages to different output destinations, such as a file, using `log.SetOutput()`.
     - It can also be configured to terminate the program when a critical error occurs using `log.Fatal()` or `log.Panic()`.

   - **`fmt.Println()`**:
     - Does not include any automatic logging features like timestamps.
     - Its sole purpose is to print output as-is.

### 4. **Common Use Cases**:
   - **`fmt.Println()`**: Printing user-facing messages, simple debugging, or informational output when you don’t need to log the execution details.
   - **`log.Println()`**: Logging system messages, status updates, or error messages that may require tracking with a timestamp.

### In Your Code:
```go
log.Println("creating template and adding to cache")
```
This is used because it's logging an internal event (creating and caching a template) that might be useful for tracking the application's behavior. `log.Println()` adds a timestamp and allows better debugging in production compared to `fmt.Println()`.
