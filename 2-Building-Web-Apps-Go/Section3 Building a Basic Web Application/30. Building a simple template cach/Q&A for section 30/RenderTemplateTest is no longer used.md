Yes, in the updated version, `RenderTemplateTest` is no longer used. The instructor replaced it with the optimized `RenderTemplate` function, which uses template caching to improve performance. The older `RenderTemplateTest` function reads and parses the template from disk every time a request is made, which is inefficient. The new `RenderTemplate` function introduces a caching mechanism to store and reuse templates, making it more efficient for handling repeated requests. 

The instructor likely moved away from `RenderTemplateTest` because the caching mechanism in `RenderTemplate` is a better practice for production applications where performance is crucial.

Yes, `templateCache[gohtml]` refers to the map `templateCache`, where `gohtml` is the name of the template (key) being checked. The code checks if the template (specified by `gohtml`) is already in the cache. If it exists, `inMap` will be `true`; otherwise, it will be `false`.

---
In the line `_, inMap := templateCache[gohtml]`, the underscore (`_`) is used to ignore the key (the value stored in the map). In this case:

- `templateCache[gohtml]` performs a lookup in the map using `gohtml` as the key.
- The first value (which would normally be the actual template) is ignored using `_`.
- The second value (`inMap`) is a boolean that indicates whether the key (`gohtml`) exists in the map.

So:

- `_` = Ignored value (in this case, it would be the actual template from the map, but we're not using it).
- `inMap` = `true` or `false`, indicating whether the template is in the cache.

This is an example of the **comma-ok idiom** in Go, where the second return value checks whether a key exists in the map.

In Go, the **map** lookup (`templateCache[gohtml]`) gives you two values: 

1. The **value** associated with the key (`gohtml`).
2. A **boolean** indicating whether the key exists in the map.

When you're only interested in whether the key exists, you can use the **comma-ok idiom** to ignore the actual value (i.e., the template itself) and focus only on whether the key exists by using the `_` placeholder.

### Why you can skip the key here:
- You only care about whether the key (`gohtml`) exists in the map (whether the template has already been cached).
- Since you don't need to use the value (the template itself) at this point, you can **ignore** it with `_` and just capture the `inMap` boolean.

### So, why skip the key?
- You're **not interested** in the value at this moment; you just want to know if the key exists (whether the template is cached or not).
- If you were to retrieve the value (i.e., the template), you'd store it in a variable instead of `_`.

### Example:
```go
value, exists := myMap[key]  // Here, `value` stores the actual value and `exists` is true/false.
_, exists := myMap[key]      // Here, you ignore `value` and only check if `exists` is true/false.
```

You can skip the actual **value** in this context because you just need to check whether the key is present. There's no need to iterate through the map for this purpose because Go allows direct access to check for key existence.

Yes, in this context, `gohtml` is the **key** in the `templateCache` map. 

The map `templateCache` is defined as `map[string]*template.Template`, where:
- **Key**: `string` (in this case, `gohtml`, the name of the template file).
- **Value**: A pointer to a parsed Go template (`*template.Template`).

When you write:

```go
_, inMap := templateCache[gohtml]
```

- `gohtml` is the **key** you're using to look up a value in the `templateCache` map.
- The expression checks if the key `gohtml` exists in the map and assigns the result (`true` or `false`) to `inMap`. If it exists, `inMap` will be `true`; otherwise, `false`.

So, `gohtml` is the key, and you're checking whether this key exists in the `templateCache` map.
