Is `make(map[string]int)` equivalent to `map[string]int{}` for creating an empty map?

---

Yes, `make(map[string]int)` is equivalent to `map[string]int{}`, which creates an empty map. However, there's a slight difference in how they work internally:

- **`make(map[string]int)`**: This explicitly creates an empty map using the `make` function. It allocates memory and returns a reference to an initialized, empty map. This is the preferred way when you want to initialize an empty map for later use.
  
- **`map[string]int{}`**: This is a literal way of declaring an empty map. It also creates an empty map but is more often used when declaring a map with some initial values.

Both will result in an empty map ready to use, but `make` is more commonly used for initializing maps.
