The expression `"./templates/" + gohtml` in Go is used to **construct a file path** by concatenating the string `./templates/` with the value of the variable `gohtml`. Here's a breakdown of its components:

### Breakdown:

1. **`"./templates/"`**: 
   - This is a **relative path** to the `templates` directory.
   - `./` refers to the **current working directory** of your Go project.
   - `templates/` refers to a folder named `templates` inside the current working directory.

2. **`gohtml` (variable)**:
   - This variable contains the **name of the template file** that you want to load, like `"home.gohtml"` or `"about.gohtml"`.
   - The variable is passed to the function (in this case, `renderTemplate`), and its value is dynamically appended to the path.

3. **`"./templates/" + gohtml` (concatenation)**:
   - The `+` operator concatenates (joins) the two strings.
   - For example, if `gohtml = "home.gohtml"`, the result of the expression is `./templates/home.gohtml`, which is the **path to the template file** in your `templates` directory.

### Example:

```go
parsedTemplate, _ := template.ParseFiles("./templates/" + gohtml)
```

- If you pass `"home.gohtml"` to the `gohtml` parameter, this line will evaluate to:
  ```go
  template.ParseFiles("./templates/home.gohtml")
  ```
  This tells Go to look for a file named `home.gohtml` inside the `templates` directory.

### In Summary:
- `"./templates/"` is the directory path where the template files are stored.
- `gohtml` is the file name (e.g., `"home.gohtml"`).
- `"./templates/" + gohtml` constructs the **full path** to the template file, so Go knows where to find and load the file from.
