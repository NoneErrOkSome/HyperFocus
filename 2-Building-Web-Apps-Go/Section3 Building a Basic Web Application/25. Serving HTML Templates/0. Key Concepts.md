### Key Concepts (with Clarifications):

1. **Serving real web pages with Go**:
   - Instead of writing plain text to the browser, Go can serve actual web pages by using a built-in package from the standard library called `html/template`. This package allows us to render full HTML templates dynamically.

2. **Cleaning up the code**:
   - Removing unnecessary functions like `add` and `divide` and leaving the `Home` and `About` handlers empty prepares the project for template rendering. The only thing left in the handlers is that they both accept a response writer (`w`) and a request (`r`) as all HTTP handlers must in Go.

3. **Organizing templates**:
   - The instructor organizes templates by creating a new folder called `templates`. Inside this folder, you store your HTML files. The instructor uses `.gohtml` or `.page.html` to distinguish them as Go templates rather than plain HTML.

4. **Using `Emmet` for HTML scaffolding**:
   - `Emmet` is an extension available in editors like VS Code or JetBrains Goland that allows for quick scaffolding of HTML (e.g., typing `html:5` generates a complete HTML5 document structure).

5. **Creating basic templates**:
   - The instructor creates simple templates for the Home and About pages. These templates contain minimal HTML markup with placeholders for dynamic content in the future. At this stage, they are static but will be rendered dynamically by Go.

6. **Rendering templates**:
   - To render templates, a new function `renderTemplate` is introduced. This function takes an `http.ResponseWriter` (think of it as "responseBack") and the template filename as arguments. It parses the specified template and writes it back to the browser window.

7. **Template parsing**:
   - Before rendering a template, it needs to be **parsed**. Parsing a template reads the file, processes any Go template syntax within it, and prepares it for execution (i.e., rendering). The instructor shows how to parse templates using Goâ€™s standard library.

8. **Executing templates**:
   - After parsing a template, the next step is to **execute** it. Executing a template involves passing it data (which can be `nil` if no data is needed) and writing the rendered HTML to the response writer.

9. **Handling multiple templates**:
   - If you have multiple pages (like `Home` and `About`), you can reuse the `renderTemplate` function to render any page you want by just passing in the filename of the template. This keeps the code clean and avoids duplication.

10. **Testing template rendering**:
    - After setting up the template rendering system, the instructor tests it by running the application and visiting `localhost:8080`. By reloading the page, they confirm that the correct template (Home or About) is rendered.

11. **Expanding templates**:
    - Once the basic template rendering works, you can easily extend your templates by adding more HTML content (e.g., adding paragraphs or closing missing tags). This shows the flexibility of Go's template rendering.

12. **Restarting the application**:
    - The instructor points out that when you modify the handler or template logic, you need to restart the Go application for the changes to take effect. This ensures that the latest version of your code is being served.

13. **Robust Go templating system**:
    - Go's templating system is part of its rich standard library and provides many powerful features. It allows dynamic content to be passed to templates, and includes logic for decisions, iterations over data, and more. While the current example is simple, the templating system is robust and can handle complex logic.

14. **Future lessons**:
    - Future lessons will explore structuring the application more logically and passing dynamic data to templates. This adds to the flexibility of Go's templating engine, allowing for interactive and data-driven pages.
