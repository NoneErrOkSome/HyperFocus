In this lecture, the instructor is explaining the importance and flexibility of having a sitewide or application-wide configuration structure (`AppConfig`). The main points the instructor is emphasizing are:

1. **Centralized Configuration**: By using a single configuration struct (`AppConfig`), the application can manage and store various settings or objects that need to be accessed globally across the entire application, such as the template cache, logging, or any other configuration values.

2. **Extensibility**: The `AppConfig` struct initially has just two fields (`UseCache` and `TemplateCache`), but it can easily be extended by adding new fields, like `InfoLog`. This makes it a powerful tool because new configurations or settings can be added as the application grows, and they'll be available to all parts of the application without significant changes in the code.

3. **Logger Example**: The instructor introduces the `InfoLog` field, which is a pointer to a `log.Logger`. Although the logging functionality isnâ€™t implemented yet, the instructor is preparing the structure for future use when error handling and logging will be centralized. The ability to log information in a structured way is useful for debugging, monitoring, and tracking application behavior.

4. **Accessibility Across the Application**: The key benefit is that once something is added to `AppConfig`, it becomes accessible to all parts of the application. This makes managing configuration settings easier and more organized compared to using global variables or passing values through multiple function calls.

In summary, the instructor is showing how powerful and flexible it is to use a centralized configuration struct to manage various settings across the entire application, making it easier to add, manage, and access important components such as caching and logging.

```go
package config

import (
	"html/template"
	"log"
)

// AppConfig holds the application config
type AppConfig struct {
	UseCache      bool
	TemplateCache map[string]*template.Template
	InfoLog       *log.Logger
}
