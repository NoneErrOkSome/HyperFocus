Here’s a detailed breakdown of what you've learned from this code:

### 1. **Template Rendering and HTTP Handling**

The `RenderTemplate` function is responsible for rendering HTML templates. This is a common task in web development when creating dynamic web pages. It uses the `http.ResponseWriter` to send the generated HTML content back to the client (the web browser). The idea is that whenever a request is made to the server, you can dynamically generate a web page using templates and send it as a response.

### 2. **Template Caching**

One of the main concepts in this code is **template caching**. Instead of reading and parsing template files from disk every time a request is made, the code reads the templates once, caches them in memory, and reuses them. This increases performance by avoiding the need to repeatedly access the file system and reparse templates on every request.

The template cache is implemented in the `createTemplateCache` function, where all the templates from the `./templates` directory are loaded into memory. This cache is represented by a `map[string]*template.Template`, where the map keys are the template names and the values are parsed `template.Template` objects.

### 3. **Detailed Function Breakdown**

#### a. **`RenderTemplate` Function**

- **Template Caching**:  
  This function starts by calling `createTemplateCache()`, which creates a map of templates, caching them in memory.
  ```go
  tc, err := createTemplateCache()
  ```
  - If an error occurs (for example, if templates can't be read), the program logs the error and terminates using `log.Fatal()`.

- **Fetching from Cache**:  
  The template to be rendered is fetched from the cache. If the template is not found, the program logs an error.
  ```go
  t, ok := tc[tmpl]
  if !ok {
      log.Fatal(err)
  }
  ```

- **Buffer Usage**:  
  The template is executed and written to a buffer (`bytes.Buffer`). This buffer temporarily holds the output before sending it to the client. By using a buffer, you can ensure that the entire template is rendered correctly before it is sent to the client.
  ```go
  buf := new(bytes.Buffer)
  err = t.Execute(buf, nil)
  ```

- **Error Handling**:  
  If there’s an error in rendering the template (e.g., if the template contains a syntax error), the program logs the error without terminating, allowing the program to handle the situation gracefully.
  ```go
  if err != nil {
      log.Println(err)
  }
  ```

- **Writing to Response**:  
  Once the template is successfully rendered into the buffer, the content is written to the `http.ResponseWriter`, which sends the response back to the client.
  ```go
  _, err = buf.WriteTo(w)
  ```

#### b. **`createTemplateCache` Function**

- **Cache Creation**:  
  The `createTemplateCache` function creates an empty map to store templates:
  ```go
  myCache := map[string]*template.Template{}
  ```

- **Filepath Glob**:  
  This is a powerful function that allows you to search for files that match a specific pattern in a directory. The code searches for all files in the `./templates` directory that end with `.page.tmpl`. These files represent the "pages" of the website.
  ```go
  pages, err := filepath.Glob("./templates/*.page.tmpl")
  ```

- **Looping through Templates**:  
  The code loops through all the files that match the pattern and parses them. The template's base name is stored in the `name` variable:
  ```go
  for _, page := range pages {
      name := filepath.Base(page)
      ts, err := template.New(name).ParseFiles(page)
  ```

- **Adding Layouts**:  
  In web development, templates often share common layouts (such as headers and footers). The code looks for layout templates (`*.layout.tmpl`) and associates them with the page templates. If any layouts are found, they are added to the template set:
  ```go
  matches, err := filepath.Glob("./templates/*.layout.tmpl")
  if len(matches) > 0 {
      ts, err = ts.ParseGlob("./templates/*.layout.tmpl")
  }
  ```

- **Adding to Cache**:  
  Once a template (along with any associated layout) is parsed, it is added to the template cache. The key in the cache is the template name (like `home.page.tmpl`), and the value is the parsed template (`ts`):
  ```go
  myCache[name] = ts
  ```

### 4. **Error Handling and Logging**

The code demonstrates how to handle errors properly:
- **`log.Fatal(err)`**: This is used when an error is critical, and the application should terminate. For example, if a template can’t be found, it’s a critical failure.
- **`log.Println(err)`**: This is used for less severe errors where the program can continue, but something went wrong. This is a good example of logging errors in a way that helps diagnose issues without stopping the server.

### 5. **Template System in Go**

Go's `html/template` package provides a powerful templating system for generating HTML dynamically. This system allows you to separate the content of your web pages from the Go code and manage common page components (like headers and footers) with layout templates.

- **`template.New(name).ParseFiles(page)`**: This creates a new template and parses the corresponding file.
- **`ts.ParseGlob`**: This function allows you to parse additional files (like layouts) and associate them with an existing template.

### Summary of What You've Learned

- **Template Caching**: Efficiently manage templates by caching them in memory, avoiding unnecessary file reads.
- **Template Execution**: Learn how to render templates dynamically and send the output to the client using `http.ResponseWriter`.
- **Error Handling**: Properly handle and log errors without crashing the server unnecessarily.
- **Filepath Glob**: Understand how to use Go’s `filepath.Glob()` function to find files based on patterns (e.g., `*.tmpl`).
- **Layouts and Partials**: Learn how to manage common parts of a webpage (e.g., headers and footers) using layout templates and combining them with page templates.

This is a foundational system that sets the stage for building more complex dynamic web applications, and by understanding this, you're preparing yourself to handle more sophisticated rendering and caching systems in Go web development.
