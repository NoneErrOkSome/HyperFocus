The key difference between `ParseFiles()` and `ParseGlob()` lies in how they handle the selection of template files to parse:

### **`ParseFiles()`**
- **Purpose**: `ParseFiles()` is used to parse specific template files whose paths are explicitly provided as arguments.
- **File Selection**: You must manually specify the paths of the files you want to parse. This method is useful when you know the exact templates you need to load.
- **Multiple Files**: You can provide multiple file paths in the arguments, but the function will only load the files you explicitly list.
- **Main Template**: The first file in the list is treated as the main template, and subsequent files are associated templates.

#### Example:
```go
t, err := template.ParseFiles("header.tmpl", "footer.tmpl", "home.page.tmpl")
```
In this case, `ParseFiles()` will load and parse only these three templates (`header.tmpl`, `footer.tmpl`, and `home.page.tmpl`), and the first file (`header.tmpl`) is treated as the main template.

### **`ParseGlob()`**
- **Purpose**: `ParseGlob()` is used to parse multiple template files that match a given pattern, such as all files with a specific extension in a directory.
- **File Selection**: It selects files based on a pattern (like `*.tmpl`). This method is useful when you have many template files that follow a similar naming pattern, and you want to load them all at once.
- **Pattern Matching**: It uses glob patterns (wildcards) to automatically match and load all files that meet the specified criteria, making it more dynamic.
- **Main Template**: There is no explicitly defined "main" template, as all matched templates are treated equally. You would typically specify the main template later when rendering.

#### Example:
```go
t, err := template.ParseGlob("./templates/*.tmpl")
```
In this case, `ParseGlob()` will load all templates in the `./templates/` directory that have the `.tmpl` extension.

### **Key Differences**:
| Feature           | `ParseFiles()`                                  | `ParseGlob()`                                      |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **File Selection** | Specific file paths provided manually           | Uses a pattern (wildcard) to select multiple files |
| **Main Template**  | The first file is treated as the main template  | No specific main template; all templates treated equally |
| **Usage**          | Good when you know exactly which files to parse | Good when you want to load all matching files dynamically |

### **Example Comparison**:

**Using `ParseFiles()`**:
```go
t, err := template.ParseFiles("header.tmpl", "footer.tmpl", "home.page.tmpl")
```
- You specify each file explicitly.

**Using `ParseGlob()`**:
```go
t, err := template.ParseGlob("./templates/*.tmpl")
```
- Automatically loads all templates with the `.tmpl` extension in the `./templates/` folder.

### **When to Use Which**:
- Use `ParseFiles()` when you want to control exactly which templates are loaded.
- Use `ParseGlob()` when you want to load multiple files based on a pattern (like all files with a certain extension) and don't need to specify them individually.
