### Part 1: **Duplicate Code Across Pages**

**Instructor's words**:  
The homepage and the about page have almost identical HTML structure, with the same head, body, and closing tags. The only difference between the two pages is the content inside a specific `<div>` tag. This duplication can become problematic if you have to update multiple pages, such as when upgrading from Bootstrap 4 to Bootstrap 5.

**Clarification**:  
This repetition of the same HTML structure across multiple pages introduces inefficiency. If a change is required (like updating the Bootstrap version), you would need to manually update every page that uses the same structure. This is manageable for two pages, but if you had hundreds or thousands of pages, it would become a major hassle. The solution is to centralize the common structure, which leads to the idea of using **layout files**.

### Code Example:
This duplication is what we want to avoid:

```go html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Home</title>
        <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"
            integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous">
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col">
                    <h1>This is the home page</h1>
                    <p>This is some text</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

### Part 2: **The Need for Layout Files**

**Instructor's words**:  
Instead of duplicating the same HTML structure across every page, we can use layout files. A layout file allows you to define how a set of pages should look and apply that layout to each page. You can have one layout template file that is applied to every page or only certain pages, depending on your needs. This saves a lot of effort by reducing duplication.

**Clarification**:  
A **layout file** is a template that contains the common HTML structure (such as the head and body sections) that remains consistent across all pages. By using a layout, you only need to manage one file for things like headers, footers, or CSS links. This approach centralizes the structure, making it easier to update the look and feel of your site. Changes to the layout affect all pages that use it, so you don't need to modify individual pages manually.

### Code Example:

The layout file centralizes the common structure of the site:

```go html template
{{define "base"}}
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Home</title>
        <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"
            integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous">
        {{block "css" .}}{{end}}
    </head>
    <body>
        {{block "content" .}}{{end}}
        {{block "js" .}}{{end}}
    </body>
    </html>
{{end}}
```

### Part 3: **Creating the Base Layout File**

**Instructor's words**:  
To create a layout file, I’ll create a new file called `base.layout.tmpl`. This file will contain the shared structure for all pages, such as the `<head>` section, `<body>`, and the general page setup. We’ll copy the common structure from one of our existing pages and paste it into this new layout file.

**Clarification**:  
The **base layout file** serves as a master template that defines the overall structure of the site. It holds elements like the HTML declaration, head, body, and common assets like CSS or JavaScript files. By using this layout file, you can remove the repetitive code from individual pages, which will instead focus only on page-specific content. This way, the layout can be reused across multiple pages without redundancy.

### Code Example:

The base layout serves as a master template:
```go html template
{{define "base"}}
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Home</title>
        <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"
            integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous">
        {{block "css" .}}{{end}}
    </head>
    <body>
        {{block "content" .}}{{end}}
        {{block "js" .}}{{end}}
    </body>
    </html>
{{end}}
```

### Part 4: **Defining Blocks in the Layout**

**Instructor's words**:  
Inside the `base.layout.tmpl` file, I’ll add **blocks** where the content can change on a per-page basis. For example, I’ll define a `content` block in the body section where the main content for each page will go. Additionally, I’ll add blocks for custom CSS and JavaScript, allowing different pages to add their own styling or scripts if needed.

**Clarification**:  
A **block** in Go templates is a placeholder where dynamic content can be inserted. The `content` block, for instance, is where each page will insert its unique content (like text or images). The other blocks for `CSS` and `JS` allow each page to include its own style rules or scripts. This structure makes the layout flexible by keeping the core structure consistent while allowing individual pages to customize certain sections.

### Code Example:

Here's how the layout defines the dynamic content blocks:

```go html template
{{define "base"}}
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Home</title>
        <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"
            integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous">
        {{block "css" .}}{{end}}
    </head>
    <body>
        {{block "content" .}}{{end}}
        {{block "js" .}}{{end}}
    </body>
    </html>
{{end}}
```

### Part 5: **Linking Templates to the Layout**

**Instructor's words**:  
To use the layout on individual pages, we’ll go to the homepage and remove all the common HTML structure, leaving only the page-specific content. At the top of the file, we’ll add a directive to use the `base` layout. We’ll also define the `content` block, which is where the page’s unique content will go.

**Clarification**:  
Each individual page template no longer needs to include the full HTML structure. Instead, it simply links to the layout file using a directive (e.g., `{{template "base" .}}`). The page-specific content is then inserted into the `content` block defined in the layout. This way, the common elements like the head and footer are centralized in the layout file, while the page-specific content remains in the individual template file. This drastically reduces duplication and simplifies managing multiple pages.

### Code Example:
Here’s the `home.page.gohtml` content:
```go html
{{template "base" .}}

{{define "content"}}
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <h1>This is the home page</h1>
                <p>This is some text</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
{{end}}
```

Here’s the `about.page.gohtml` content:
```go html
{{template "base" .}}

{{define "content"}}
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <h1>This is the about page</h1>
                <p>This is about page</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
{{end}}
```

By centralizing the common elements in a layout file, using blocks for dynamic content, and linking each page template to the layout, the code becomes more manageable and efficient. It reduces duplication and makes updates across the site easier to implement.
