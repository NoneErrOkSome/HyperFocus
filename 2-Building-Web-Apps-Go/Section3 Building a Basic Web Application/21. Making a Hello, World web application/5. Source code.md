Here's your source code with detailed comments and an explanation of what you've learned:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	// Handle the root URL "/"
	http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		// Fprintf writes the "Hello, world!" message to the HTTP response writer (w)
		// n will store the number of bytes written, and err will store any errors encountered
		n, err := fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, world!")
		
		// If there was an error in writing the response, log the error to the console
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println(err)
		}

		// Print the number of bytes written to the console for debugging
		fmt.Println(fmt.Sprintf("Number of bytes written: %d", n))
	})

	// Start the HTTP server on port 8080 and listen for incoming requests
	_ = http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil) // The underscore ignores any error from ListenAndServe
}
```

### What You've Learned from the Code:

1. **Handling HTTP Requests**:
   - The `http.HandleFunc` is used to define a function to handle incoming HTTP requests. The path `/` corresponds to the root URL of the server. When a client visits `http://localhost:8080/`, the provided function gets executed.

2. **Writing HTTP Responses**:
   - The `fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, world!")` sends the text `"Hello, world!"` to the client as an HTTP response. This function writes directly to the `ResponseWriter` (represented by `w`), which sends data back to the client.
   - The function also returns the number of bytes written (`n`) and any error (`err`) encountered while writing the response.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If an error occurs while writing the response (e.g., the client connection was lost), the program checks if `err` is not `nil`. If there's an error, it's printed to the console using `fmt.Println(err)` for debugging.

4. **Debugging Output**:
   - The line `fmt.Println(fmt.Sprintf("Number of bytes written: %d", n))` is used to print the number of bytes written to the console. This is helpful for debugging to ensure that the correct amount of data is being sent to the client.

5. **Starting an HTTP Server**:
   - The `http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)` starts an HTTP server on port 8080. The server will listen for incoming connections and use the registered handler (in this case, the function defined in `HandleFunc`) to respond to requests.
   - The `_` is used to ignore any error returned by `ListenAndServe`, which would typically stop the program if an error occurs (e.g., if the port is already in use).

### Key Takeaways:
- **HTTP Basics**: You've learned how to handle basic HTTP requests and send responses back to the client using `http.HandleFunc` and `http.ResponseWriter`.
- **Response Writing**: The `fmt.Fprintf` function is used to write a response back to the client, and it also gives you useful information like how many bytes were written.
- **Error Handling**: Errors during HTTP request handling (like connection problems) can be detected and logged.
- **Server Initialization**: You've started a simple web server in Go, running locally on port 8080, and handling requests using built-in HTTP functions.
