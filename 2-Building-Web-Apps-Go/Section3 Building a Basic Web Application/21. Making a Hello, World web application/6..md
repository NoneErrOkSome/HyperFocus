```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	// http.HandleFunc is part of the Go standard library’s `net/http` package, which provides the fundamental building blocks for creating web servers.
	// This function is used to handle incoming requests at a specified URL path ("/" in this case).
	// The second argument is an inline function, or handler, which will process incoming requests and send back a response.

	http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		// `fmt.Fprintf` is used here to write a response to the `ResponseWriter` (w), which is sent back to the client (the web browser in this case).
		// This function returns two values: the number of bytes written (n) and any errors encountered during the writing process (err).
		n, err := fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, world!")

		// Error handling: if there's an error while writing to the `ResponseWriter`, it will be printed to the server's console.
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println(err)
		}

		// Logging: the number of bytes written is printed to the server's console.
		// This is useful for debugging or simply monitoring how much data was sent to the client.
		fmt.Println(fmt.Sprintf("Number of bytes written: %d", n))
	})

	// `http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)` starts the web server on port 8080. 
	// The server listens for incoming HTTP requests and uses the handlers (like the one defined above) to respond to them.
	// The second argument is nil, meaning the default request multiplexer is used. If you pass a custom handler here, you can customize routing behavior.
	// The underscore (`_`) is used to ignore the error returned by `ListenAndServe`. In real applications, you would want to handle this error properly.
	_ = http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}

### Explanation Based on the Transcript (Using Instructor's Words with Added Clarifications):

1. **Starting the Web Application**:  
   "This time, instead of just printing Hello World to the screen, I want to create a web application that listens on a particular port... That is actually pretty simple."
   
   - **Clarification**: The goal here is to create a simple web server in Go that listens for HTTP requests on port `8080`. When a client (like a web browser) makes a request to this server, the server will send back a "Hello, world!" message as the response.

2. **Using `http.HandleFunc` to Define Request Handling**:  
   "We're going to use a built-in package that's part of the standard library for Go called `http`... It's one that deals with the web."
   
   - **Clarification**: The `http.HandleFunc` function from Go’s `net/http` package is used to specify how the server should respond to requests at a particular URL path (in this case, "/"). When the root path is accessed, this handler function will process the request and send back a response.

3. **Inline Function and Request Handling**:  
   "What I'm going to give them is I'm actually going to inline a function here... the `http.ResponseWriter` (w)... and `http.Request` (r)..."
   
   - **Clarification**: The handler function is defined inline (within the call to `http.HandleFunc`). It takes two parameters: `w`, which is an `http.ResponseWriter` for writing responses back to the client, and `r`, which is the `http.Request` representing the incoming request from the client.

4. **Working with `ResponseWriter` and `Request`**:  
   "Every `http` handler function has to deal with responses and requests... So I have my function partly written here."
   
   - **Clarification**: Every handler function in Go works with these two essential elements: the `ResponseWriter` (used to send data back to the client) and the `Request` (which contains details about the incoming request). In this case, we're simply responding with a "Hello, world!" message by writing to `ResponseWriter`.

5. **Writing a Response Using `fmt.Fprintf`**:  
   "`fmt.Fprintf` actually requires a `ResponseWriter` to write to... Well, I have one right here, the `w`, so let's put that in there."
   
   - **Clarification**: The `fmt.Fprintf` function is used to send a formatted string (in this case, "Hello, world!") to the client through the `ResponseWriter` (`w`). The function also returns the number of bytes written and any errors encountered during this process.

6. **Handling Errors**:  
   "`n` will be an int (representing the number of bytes written) and `err` will be of type error."
   
   - **Clarification**: Since `fmt.Fprintf` returns an error (if something goes wrong), we check if the `err` variable is not `nil`. If an error occurred, it will be printed to the console. Otherwise, the program continues.

7. **Printing the Number of Bytes Written**:  
   "Let's print the number of bytes written... using `fmt.Sprintf` to combine a string and a variable."
   
   - **Clarification**: The number of bytes written (stored in the variable `n`) is printed to the console. This is done using `fmt.Sprintf`, which formats the output as a string before printing it. This helps monitor how much data was sent back to the client in the response.

8. **Starting the Web Server**:  
   "I have to start a process that listens for requests from web browsers... `http.ListenAndServe` starts a web server that listens for incoming requests."
   
   - **Clarification**: The `http.ListenAndServe` function starts the web server and makes it listen on port `8080`. When a request is made to the server, the handler function (previously defined) is executed, and the appropriate response is sent back.

9. **Ignoring the Error from `ListenAndServe`**:  
   "This also has an error it's listening for... but I don't want to handle this error."
   
   - **Clarification**: While `ListenAndServe` returns an error (for example, if it fails to start the server), we choose to ignore it by assigning it to an underscore (`_`). In production environments, you'd typically handle this error (e.g., logging it), but here it’s intentionally discarded.

10. **Testing the Web Server**:  
   "Let's make sure this works... I'm going to go to my web browser and visit `localhost:8080`."
   
   - **Clarification**: After running the Go program, you can open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:8080` to see the "Hello, world!" message returned by the server. At the same time, the terminal should log how many bytes were written to the response.

11. **Production-Ready Web Server**:  
   "What I have just done with one line of code is started a production-quality web server to listen for requests."
   
   - **Clarification**: With just a few lines of code, Go provides the ability to run a fully functional, production-quality web server. While this example is simple, the same infrastructure could be used to handle more complex web applications.

### Key Takeaway:
This code provides the fundamental structure of a web server in Go, leveraging Go’s built-in `net/http` package to handle incoming HTTP requests, process them, and send responses back to the client. With minimal code, Go allows you to quickly set up a production-ready web server.
