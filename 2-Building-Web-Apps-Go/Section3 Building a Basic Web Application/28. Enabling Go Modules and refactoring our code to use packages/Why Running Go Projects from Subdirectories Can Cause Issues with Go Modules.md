The reason why your Go project works when you run it from the **root directory** with the command `go run ./cmd/web` but doesn't work when you're inside the `cmd/web` directory and try to use `go run .` or `go run main.go` is because of how **Go modules** handle package paths and the **current working directory**.

Here’s why it happens:

### 1. **Go Modules and the Root Directory**:
   When you initialize a Go module with `go mod init`, the `go.mod` file is created in the **root directory** of your project. This file defines the **module name** and manages dependencies. 

   - When you run `go run ./cmd/web` from the root directory, Go knows how to find the `go.mod` file, and it understands the module path (`goCourse`, for example).
   - Go will also automatically locate all necessary packages within the module, including any relative imports like `myReview/pkg/handlers` or `myReview/pkg/render`.

### 2. **Running Go from the Subdirectory (cmd/web)**:
   When you `cd` into the `cmd/web` directory and try to run `go run .` or `go run main.go`, Go expects to find the `go.mod` file in the **current directory or its parent directories**. However, since the `go.mod` file is in the **root directory**, Go doesn't know about the module or how to resolve the imports correctly.

   - This is why running the Go application from within a subdirectory like `cmd/web` doesn't work.
   - Go modules expect you to run the application from the root of the module (where `go.mod` is located).

### 3. **Why `go run ./cmd/web` Works from the Root**:
   When you run `go run ./cmd/web` from the **root directory**, Go is able to:
   - Find the `go.mod` file at the root.
   - Resolve the module path and correctly load all package imports.
   - Identify the `main.go` file in `cmd/web` and run it as the entry point of the application.

### How to Work Around This:
   If you need to run the application while inside the `cmd/web` directory, you could try running the following command that explicitly references the module root:
   ```bash
   go run ../..
   ```
   This works because Go will look for `go.mod` in the parent directories, allowing it to resolve imports correctly.

### Best Practice:
The best practice in Go projects is to always run the application from the **root of the module**, where the `go.mod` file is located. This ensures that Go can correctly resolve dependencies and import paths based on the module definition.

### Summary:
- **Running from the root directory**: `go run ./cmd/web` works because Go can find `go.mod` and resolve all imports and dependencies.
- **Running from the subdirectory**: `go run .` doesn’t work because Go can’t find the `go.mod` file, so it can’t resolve module paths correctly.
- **Best practice**: Always run your Go applications from the root of the module to avoid these issues.
