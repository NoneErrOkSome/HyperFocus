1. Why does the `RenderTemplate` function use a pointer for `var app *config.AppConfig`, but the `main` function does not?

In the `RenderTemplate` function, the `var app *config.AppConfig` is a pointer because it needs to reference the same shared configuration that was set in the `main` function without creating a copy of it. By using a pointer, we ensure that `RenderTemplate` works with the actual configuration (the template cache, for instance) that was initialized in `main.go`.

In contrast, in the `main` function, you don't need a pointer at the beginning because you're creating and initializing the `AppConfig` instance there. Once it's created and populated with necessary data (like the template cache), you pass a pointer to that struct (using `&app`) to other parts of the program, like the `render` package.

Here's why it's structured that way:

- **In `RenderTemplate` (or other functions that use `app`)**: You want to access the same instance of `AppConfig` that was initialized in `main.go`. Using a pointer (`*config.AppConfig`) ensures that you are referencing the same memory location and accessing the shared configuration settings across your application.

- **In `main.go`**: You create the `AppConfig` struct normally because this is where you are initializing the configuration. Once it's initialized, you pass the pointer to it (using `&app`) to other parts of the program.

In summary, using the pointer in `RenderTemplate` (and elsewhere) ensures that all parts of your program access the same shared configuration without creating copies of it.

2. If you don’t use a pointer in `RenderTemplate`, will it create a copy in the `main` function? /brief

Yes, if you don’t use a pointer, the `AppConfig` would be copied into the `main` function or any other place, creating separate instances. This means changes made in one place wouldn’t reflect in others, unlike with a pointer, which allows shared access to the same instance across the program.

3. Is the reason we use a pointer in `RenderTemplate` to avoid creating a new copy of `AppConfig`, while allowing changes in the `main` function?

Exactly! We don't want to create a new copy of the `AppConfig` in the `main` function because the changes made in `main` (like setting `TemplateCache`) need to affect the original `AppConfig`. By using a pointer, any changes made in `main` or other parts of the application that use `AppConfig` will reflect everywhere, ensuring that configuration is consistent and shared across the entire application.
