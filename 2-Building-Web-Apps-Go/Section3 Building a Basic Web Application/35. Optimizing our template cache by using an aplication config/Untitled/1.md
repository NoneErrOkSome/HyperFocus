Here are the topics I can list from the lecture transcript:

1. **Application-wide Configuration (AppConfig)**:
   - Introduction of the `AppConfig` struct to hold shared settings and resources across the application.

2. **Template Caching**:
   - Caching templates at the application start to avoid reloading them for every page request.
   - Differentiating between development mode (reloading templates) and production mode (using cached templates).

3. **Configuring the Application Cache**:
   - How to store and retrieve the template cache using the centralized config.
   - Configuring the use of the cache via a `useCache` setting in the `AppConfig`.

4. **Repository Pattern**:
   - Explanation and introduction of the repository pattern to facilitate access to shared resources (like the config) across different parts of the application.

5. **Using the Repository in Handlers**:
   - Setting up handlers to use the repository so that they can access the shared configuration, including the template cache.

6. **Accessing the Template Cache in Render**:
   - How to access the cached templates in the `RenderTemplate` function without needing to reload templates from disk.

7. **Passing Configuration Data to Other Components**:
   - Using the `new templates` function to pass the application configuration to other parts of the code, like the rendering system.

8. **Switching Between Development and Production Modes**:
   - Controlling whether to use the cache or reload templates dynamically by reading the `useCache` setting from the `AppConfig`.

9. **Efficient Template Handling**:
   - Reducing the overhead of reloading templates by caching them once at startup.

10. **Logging Configuration**:
    - Adding an `InfoLog` to the `AppConfig` struct for centralized logging across the application.

11. **Future Scalability with the AppConfig**:
    - Preparing the application for future additions like database connections and other shared resources using the same pattern.

12. **Avoiding Redundant Configurations**:
    - Centralizing settings like template cache and logging, so they are not redefined or reloaded unnecessarily across the application.

These topics collectively aim to improve the application's efficiency, maintainability, and scalability by centralizing configuration and managing resources like templates more effectively.
