Does everything start from the `CreateTemplateCache` function? I understand that this function initially reads templates from the disk and stores them in a cache. My assumption was that the cache itself was stored on the disk, but I now understand it's actually in memory (RAM). Can you clarify the step-by-step improvements we made to shift from disk access to using in-memory caching (RAM)?

You’re exactly right in noticing that `CreateTemplateCache()` is where the process of managing templates begins. This journey started with reading templates from the disk every time a page request occurred, which was slow and inefficient. Here’s a step-by-step outline of the improvements made to optimize the process, moving template handling from disk-based retrieval to using cache stored in memory (RAM):

### Step-by-Step Improvements to Template Caching

1. **Initial Approach - Read from Disk Directly**  
   - **Process**: In the early version, templates were read directly from disk every time a page was loaded.
   - **Drawback**: This approach was slow, especially under load, since accessing disk storage repeatedly takes time and reduces performance.

2. **Introducing `CreateTemplateCache()` - Building a Cache on Startup**  
   - **Process**: The `CreateTemplateCache()` function was created to load templates from the disk only once, storing the parsed templates in a `map[string]*template.Template` (the cache).
   - **Improvement**: Instead of reading from disk on each request, the templates are stored in a memory-based cache, significantly reducing disk reads and speeding up the application.
   - **How**: When the application starts, `CreateTemplateCache()` reads all the `.page.gohtml` templates from the disk, parses them, and stores them in a cache map in memory.

3. **AppConfig Integration - Centralizing Configuration Access**  
   - **Process**: The `AppConfig` struct was introduced to hold application-wide configurations, including the template cache (`TemplateCache`).
   - **Improvement**: With `AppConfig`, the cached templates could be accessed across different parts of the application without recreating or re-reading them, avoiding redundant cache creation.
   - **How**: `AppConfig` is passed from `main.go` to various packages, allowing the cached templates in memory to be accessed globally.

4. **Conditional Cache Use - Supporting Development and Production Modes**  
   - **Process**: A boolean `UseCache` flag in `AppConfig` allows the program to decide whether to reuse the in-memory cache (`true`) or rebuild it (`false`).
   - **Improvement**: In development mode, templates can be reloaded with each request (when `UseCache` is `false`), making it easy to see changes without restarting the application. In production mode, templates are served from the memory cache for maximum efficiency.
   - **How**: By checking the `UseCache` flag, the application can choose whether to retrieve templates from `app.TemplateCache` or call `CreateTemplateCache()` again.

### Summary

The transition moved from **reading templates from disk every time (slowest)** ➔ **caching templates in memory (faster)** ➔ **using `AppConfig` to share the cache (organized)** ➔ **adding a conditional cache flag for development/production flexibility (most efficient for both modes)**.

In this final setup:
- **Production Mode** (with `UseCache` set to `true`): Templates are served directly from the in-memory cache.
- **Development Mode** (with `UseCache` set to `false`): Templates are reloaded from disk as needed, allowing for real-time changes.

This combination minimizes disk usage, maximizes performance, and offers flexible configuration across the application.
