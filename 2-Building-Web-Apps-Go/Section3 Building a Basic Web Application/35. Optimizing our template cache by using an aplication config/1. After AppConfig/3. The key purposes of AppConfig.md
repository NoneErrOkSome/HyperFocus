Yes, one of the key purposes of `AppConfig` in this case is to store the template cache in memory. Storing templates in memory through caching offers several important benefits:

### 1. **Improved Performance:**
   - **Faster Access:** Reading from memory is significantly faster than reading from disk. Once templates are loaded into the cache (stored in memory), subsequent requests for those templates will retrieve them from memory, avoiding slow disk I/O. This makes rendering pages much quicker.
   - **Reduced Latency:** Since accessing the cache in memory is quicker, your web pages can be rendered and served to users faster, improving the overall user experience.

### 2. **Reduced Disk I/O:**
   - **Less Load on the Disk:** By loading templates into memory once at startup, you minimize the number of times you need to read from the disk. This reduces disk usage and wear, especially important on high-traffic websites, where constant disk reads could slow down the system.
   - **Better Scalability:** As traffic increases, the performance impact of disk I/O becomes more noticeable. Storing templates in memory helps the system scale better, handling more requests with less disk overhead.

### 3. **Centralized Configuration:**
   - **App-wide Sharing:** The `AppConfig` struct provides a centralized location to store application-wide settings, like template caching, loggers, or flags (e.g., `UseCache`). This makes it easier to access and share these resources across different parts of the application, such as handlers, render functions, or middleware.
   - **Single Source of Truth:** By keeping all configuration and resources in `AppConfig`, it becomes easier to manage and maintain, as you don't need to pass these settings around individually in every function or module.

### 4. **Development Mode Flexibility:**
   - **Dynamic Reloading Option:** During development, you might want to bypass the cache to reload templates from disk on every request (to see changes immediately). With `AppConfig`, you can add a flag like `UseCache` to control this behavior. In production, you can enable caching for better performance, and in development, you can disable it for convenience.

### 5. **Less Redundancy and DRY Code:**
   - **Avoid Re-Parsing Templates:** Without a cache, you would need to re-parse the same template file every time a page is rendered. This introduces redundancy and repeated work. By caching templates, you ensure that templates are parsed once and reused, adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

### Summary:
Storing templates in memory using `AppConfig` improves performance, reduces the load on the disk, and allows centralized management of application-wide resources. It helps to keep the code more efficient and scalable while also providing flexibility for development and production environments.
