**3.** So essentially, this approach links the `AppConfig` to the `render` package via `main.go`, correct?

so basically you just link to the config through main.go?

---

Yes, exactly! The `main.go` file acts as the central point that initializes and configures the application settings (`AppConfig`). By linking `render` and `handlers` (or other packages that need configuration) to `AppConfig` through `main.go`, it ensures that:

- **Shared Configuration**: All packages reference the same configuration settings, like whether to use a cached template or rebuild templates dynamically, without each package needing to recreate or redefine these settings.
- **Centralized Control**: The `main.go` file has centralized control over the applicationâ€™s configuration, which makes it easier to adjust settings (like switching from development to production mode) in one place.
  
The function that sets up the link in `render` (like `InitTemplateConfig`) is essentially just passing a pointer to `AppConfig` so that `render` can use the configuration data stored in `config`. This keeps the structure flexible and ensures any change to `AppConfig` in `main.go` is available across packages.
