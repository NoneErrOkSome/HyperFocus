The "previous version" I was referring to is the version where `RenderTemplate` did not use the `AppConfig` struct to store the template cache. Instead, the template cache was recreated every time `RenderTemplate` was called, which was inefficient.

For example:

### Less Efficient Version:
```go
func RenderTemplate(w http.ResponseWriter, templateName string) {
    templateCache, err := CreateTemplateCache()
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal("Error creating template cache:", err)
    }

    templ, ok := templateCache[templateName]
    if !ok {
        log.Fatal("Template not found in cache:", templateName)
    }

    outputBuffer := new(bytes.Buffer)
    err = templ.Execute(outputBuffer, nil)
    if err != nil {
        log.Println("Error executing template:", err)
    }

    _, err = outputBuffer.WriteTo(w)
    if err != nil {
        log.Println("Error writing template to browser:", err)
    }
}
```
In this version, the `CreateTemplateCache()` function was called every time the `RenderTemplate` function was executed, which meant the template cache was recreated with every request.

### More Efficient Version:
In the version you've currently shared, the template cache is stored in the `AppConfig` struct, and only created once at application startup, and reused afterward:

```go
var app *config.AppConfig

// NewTemplate sets the config for the template package
func NewTemplate(a *config.AppConfig) {
    app = a
}

func RenderTemplate(w http.ResponseWriter, templateName string) {
    templateCache := app.TemplateCache

    templ, ok := templateCache[templateName]
    if !ok {
        log.Fatal("could not get template from template cache")
    }

    outputBuffer := new(bytes.Buffer)
    _ = templ.Execute(outputBuffer, nil)
    _, err := outputBuffer.WriteTo(w)
    if err != nil {
        log.Println(err)
    }
}
```
In this version, the template cache is created once and stored in `AppConfig`, making the rendering process faster and more efficient because templates are not loaded from disk with each request.

Yes, you are correct. You didn't remove or change anything from the previous version; you only added functionality by introducing `AppConfig` to store the template cache, improving efficiency by caching templates once at startup instead of recreating them for every request.
