Youâ€™re correct that one of the goals of using `AppConfig` is to avoid reading templates from the disk repeatedly and instead rely on a template cache. 

In the earlier version (before introducing `AppConfig`), you manually defined templates by looping through files and parsing them (using something like `ParseFiles` or `ParseGlob`), and even though this avoided hardcoding every template, you were still reading the templates from disk for each request.

**What changed with `AppConfig` and template caching:**
- **Before `AppConfig`:** Each time you called `RenderTemplate`, the code would read from the disk to parse the templates (whether using `ParseFiles` or `ParseGlob`). Even though you looped through files automatically, it still caused the system to read from the disk on every request. This was inefficient because disk I/O is slow compared to reading from memory.

- **After `AppConfig`:** By introducing the `AppConfig` struct and the `TemplateCache` field, you changed the system to read all templates once (at startup) and store them in memory (the template cache). Now, whenever `RenderTemplate` is called, the function pulls the template from the cache (in memory) instead of hitting the disk every time. This makes rendering templates faster because memory access is significantly quicker than disk access.

- **How it works now:** 
  - At application startup, you call `CreateTemplateCache`, which reads all the template files from the disk, parses them, and stores them in `AppConfig.TemplateCache`. 
  - During a request, instead of reading from the disk, `RenderTemplate` accesses the template cache from memory (`AppConfig.TemplateCache`) to get the appropriate template, skipping the slow disk read.

In summary:
- **Before `AppConfig**: You were reading from the disk on every request.
- **With `AppConfig` and template caching**: Templates are read from disk once at startup and stored in memory, so future requests read from memory, not the disk.

Your recent version automatically loads templates into the cache at startup and avoids reading from the disk for every request, improving performance significantly.
