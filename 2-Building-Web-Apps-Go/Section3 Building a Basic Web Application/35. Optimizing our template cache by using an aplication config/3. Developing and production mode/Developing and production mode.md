The **development mode** and **production mode** concepts are related to how applications handle different behaviors during development versus when they are deployed in a live, production environment.

### Key Differences:
- **Development Mode**:
  - Focuses on allowing developers to **make changes** to the application and immediately see the effects.
  - Often configured to **reload resources** (like templates or configuration) with each request, so any changes to files are immediately reflected without restarting the application.
  - Enables more **detailed logging** to help identify and troubleshoot issues.
  - **Less efficient**, since it constantly reads files from disk instead of caching.

- **Production Mode**:
  - Focuses on **performance and stability**.
  - Often uses **cached resources** (like templates) to avoid unnecessary file reads from disk, which improves speed.
  - Disables unnecessary features, such as **detailed logging**, that may slow down the application.
  - Once the application is deployed, it does **not reload resources** unless restarted or specifically instructed.

### How Development and Production Mode are Managed in the Code:
In your code, the **distinction between development and production mode** is controlled through the `UseCache` flag inside the `AppConfig` struct. This flag determines whether to use cached templates (production mode) or to reload templates on every request (development mode).

#### Code Explanation:
1. **Setting `UseCache` in `main.go`**:
   ```go
   app.UseCache = false  // For development mode
   ```

   In **development mode**, you set `app.UseCache = false`, meaning templates will **not** be cached and will be reloaded from disk every time a page is rendered. This is useful because you can edit templates and see changes without restarting the server.

   In **production mode**, you would set `app.UseCache = true`, meaning templates will be **cached in memory**, and the application will read them from memory on every request, avoiding unnecessary disk access and improving performance.

2. **Checking `UseCache` in `render.go`**:
   ```go
   if app.UseCache {
       tc = app.TemplateCache
   } else {
       tc, _ = CreateTemplateCache() // Reloads templates from disk
   }
   ```

   - If `app.UseCache` is `true` (production mode), the application uses the **cached templates** stored in memory (`app.TemplateCache`).
   - If `app.UseCache` is `false` (development mode), the application **rebuilds the template cache** on every request, re-reading the templates from the file system.

#### Purpose of These Modes:
- **Development Mode**:
   - Lets you **see changes immediately** without restarting the app by loading templates from disk.
   - Helps catch errors while you're actively working on the application.
   
- **Production Mode**:
   - Optimizes performance by **using cached templates** in memory, reducing disk I/O operations.
   - Improves stability by ensuring that changes only happen when the application is deliberately restarted.

### Summary of Development vs Production Mode in Code:
- **Use `UseCache = false` for development mode** to reload templates on every request (helpful for immediate feedback when making changes).
- **Use `UseCache = true` for production mode** to store templates in memory and avoid reloading them from disk on every request, boosting efficiency.
