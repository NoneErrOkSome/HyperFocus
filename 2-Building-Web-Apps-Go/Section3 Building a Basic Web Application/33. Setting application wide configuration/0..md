The purpose of this lesson is to teach how to implement a more efficient template caching mechanism in Go by introducing application-wide configuration management. The instructor aims to avoid reloading and recreating the template cache for every request, which is inefficient. Instead, the goal is to cache the templates once and reuse them throughout the application's lifecycle.

The instructor explains the process of creating an application-wide configuration struct (`app.config`) to store shared data, like the template cache, that can be accessed from any part of the program. This prevents redundant template loading and ensures that the cache is loaded once, reducing the overhead of re-parsing templates for every request.

Additionally, the instructor emphasizes good software engineering practices, such as avoiding global variables and cyclic imports, and instead using a well-structured configuration package. The lesson ultimately highlights the importance of proper resource management and application scalability by setting up reusable and centralized configurations.
