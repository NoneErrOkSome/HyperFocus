`fmt.Sprintf` in Go is a function that formats strings according to a format specifier and returns the formatted string. It is similar to `fmt.Printf`, but instead of printing the formatted output to the console, `Sprintf` returns it as a string that can be used elsewhere in your code.

### Example:
```go
result := fmt.Sprintf("Hello, %s! You have %d new messages.", "Alice", 5)
```

Here, `%s` is a placeholder for a string, and `%d` is a placeholder for an integer. The function returns the formatted string:
```
Hello, Alice! You have 5 new messages.
```

**Key Points**:
- Returns a formatted string instead of printing it.
- Supports various format specifiers like `%s` (string), `%d` (integer), `%f` (float), etc.

`fmt.Println(fmt.Sprintf())` is a combination of two functions in Go. Here's a breakdown:

1. **`fmt.Sprintf()`**: This function formats a string according to the specified format and returns the formatted string. It does not print anything to the console by itself.
   
   Example:
   ```go
   formattedString := fmt.Sprintf("Hello, %s!", "Alice")
   ```

2. **`fmt.Println()`**: This function prints whatever argument it receives to the console, followed by a newline.

When combined as `fmt.Println(fmt.Sprintf())`, it means that:
- `fmt.Sprintf()` is used to format the string.
- `fmt.Println()` then prints the formatted string returned by `fmt.Sprintf()` to the console.

### Example:
```go
fmt.Println(fmt.Sprintf("Hello, %s! You have %d new messages.", "Alice", 5))
```
This will print:
```
Hello, Alice! You have 5 new messages.
```
