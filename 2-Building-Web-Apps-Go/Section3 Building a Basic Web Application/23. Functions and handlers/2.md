Here’s the breakdown with code from the explanation, building on each concept mentioned:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

const portNumber = ":8080" // Step 8: Defining a constant for the port number to improve readability

// Step 3: Creating the Home page handler
// Home is the home page handler that returns "This is the home page" to the client
func Home(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	// Step 5: Writing the response for the Home page
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "This is the home page")
}

// Step 3: Creating the About page handler
// About is the about page handler, which calls the addValue function
func About(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	// Step 6: Adding logic in the About handler
	// We call addValue to calculate the sum of 2 + 2 and display it
	sum := addValue(2, 2) 
	// Using fmt.Fprintf to send the calculated sum in the response
	_, _ = fmt.Fprintf(w, fmt.Sprintf("This is the about page and 2 + 2 is %d", sum))
}

// Step 6: Creating a utility function
// addValue adds two integers and returns the sum
func addValue(x, y int) int {
	return x + y
}

// Step 10: Main application function (entry point of the program)
// main starts the web server and maps routes to handlers
func main() {
	// Step 4: Mapping URLs to their respective handler functions
	http.HandleFunc("/", Home)  // Home page
	http.HandleFunc("/about", About)  // About page

	// Step 9: Adding console feedback to show the port number
	fmt.Println(fmt.Sprintf("Starting application on port %s", portNumber))

	// Step 7: Starting the web server on port 8080
	_ = http.ListenAndServe(portNumber, nil)  // Ignoring error for now
}
```

### Breakdown by Step:

1. **Starting with the Previous Web Application:**
   - We started with a simple Hello World web app, but now we’ve improved the structure. This code demonstrates how we moved from a single `main` function handling everything to multiple handler functions.

2. **Improving the Application by Adding Pages:**
   - We've added two pages: `/` (home page) and `/about` (about page). This demonstrates how to create a multi-page web app by defining two different handler functions and mapping them to URLs.

3. **Creating Separate Handler Functions:**
   - The `Home` and `About` functions are defined as handlers. Both functions take in the necessary parameters (`http.ResponseWriter` and `*http.Request`), as required for HTTP handlers in Go.

4. **Mapping URLs to Functions:**
   - We use `http.HandleFunc("/", Home)` to map the root URL (`/`) to the `Home` function, and `http.HandleFunc("/about", About)` to map the `/about` URL to the `About` function.

5. **Adding Logic to Handler Functions:**
   - In the `About` handler, we calculate the sum of 2 + 2 by calling the `addValue` function. This shows how to add business logic to the handler.

6. **Creating Utility Functions:**
   - The `addValue` function is an example of a simple utility function. It adds two integers and returns the result. This keeps our handlers clean and separates concerns.

7. **Handling Potential Errors:**
   - We don’t have complex error handling here, but as noted in the previous explanation, the framework is set up to handle potential errors in more complex scenarios.

8. **Improving Readability with Constants:**
   - Instead of hardcoding the port number, we define it as a constant (`portNumber`). This improves readability and makes it easier to change if needed.

9. **Providing Console Feedback:**
   - Before starting the server, we print a message to the console using `fmt.Println` to notify the user that the application is starting and which port it’s using.

10. **Lowercase vs Uppercase Function Names:**
    - The function `addValue` starts with a lowercase letter, meaning it’s private to the package. Since `main.go` is the main package, there’s no need to make this function public. But we learned the importance of uppercase vs lowercase in making functions accessible outside the package.

11. **Adding Comments to the Code:**
    - We added comments to each function, explaining its purpose. This helps others (or your future self) understand what each function does, even though the code is self-explanatory.

### Summary:
This code is a well-structured, basic web application in Go that demonstrates multiple concepts, such as separating concerns using handler functions, utility functions, and constants. It also introduces good practices like logging server activity and commenting code.
