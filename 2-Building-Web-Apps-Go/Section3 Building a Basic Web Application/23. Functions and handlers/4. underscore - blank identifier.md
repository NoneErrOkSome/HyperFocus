In Go, the `_` (underscore) is known as the **blank identifier**. It is used to ignore values returned by a function when you don't need to use them. 

In the line:

```go
_, _ = fmt.Fprintf(w, fmt.Sprintf("This is the about page and 2 + 2 is %d", sum))
```

`fmt.Fprintf` returns two values:
1. The number of bytes written (an `int`).
2. Any error encountered (of type `error`).

By using `_, _`, you're essentially saying that you **don't care** about these return values (both the number of bytes written and the error), so you're discarding them.

### Why would you do this?
Sometimes a function returns values that you don't need. Instead of storing them in variables that you'll never use, you can use `_` to indicate that you're intentionally ignoring those values.

In this case:
- The first `_` is for the number of bytes written.
- The second `_` is for the potential error.

If you needed to use those values, you would capture them in variables like this:

```go
n, err := fmt.Fprintf(w, fmt.Sprintf("This is the about page and 2 + 2 is %d", sum))
```
Here, `n` would store the number of bytes written, and `err` would store any error returned by the `Fprintf` function.

The `Sprintf` and `Fprintf` functions in Go stand for **"String Printf"** and **"File Printf"** respectively. Here's a more detailed breakdown:

### `fmt.Sprintf`
- **"Sprintf"** stands for **String Printf**.
- **Purpose**: It formats a string and returns it (instead of printing it to a terminal or output stream).
- **Usage**: When you want to create a formatted string without printing it immediately, you use `Sprintf`.
  
Example:
```go
formattedString := fmt.Sprintf("Hello, %s!", "Alice")
fmt.Println(formattedString)  // Output: Hello, Alice!
```
- Here, the `%s` is replaced with `"Alice"`, but the string is not printed directly. Instead, it is stored in `formattedString` for later use.

### `fmt.Fprintf`
- **"Fprintf"** stands for **File Printf**, though it is more general than just writing to files.
- **Purpose**: It formats a string and writes it to a specified output (like a file, HTTP response, or
