Here’s an optimized version of your `handlers` package code:

### Improvements:
1. **Comments**: Added more meaningful comments to improve code readability.
2. **Error Handling**: While there isn’t much to optimize structurally, I've ensured that the function names and imports are kept clean.

### Optimized Code:

```go
package handlers

import (
	"net/http"
	"Neso/pkg/render"
)

// Home handles the home page requests
func Home(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	render.RenderTemplate(w, "home.page.gohtml")
}

// About handles the about page requests
func About(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	render.RenderTemplate(w, "about.page.gohtml")
}
```

### Key Points:
1. **Comments**: Clear, simple comments for the `Home` and `About` functions to explain their purpose.
2. **No Redundant Code**: The code is already quite optimized. It focuses on cleanly forwarding requests to the rendering function without unnecessary complexity.

The structure is already minimal and efficient for its purpose. Let me know if you'd like any additional improvements or further optimizations!
