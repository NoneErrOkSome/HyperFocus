How does this code work behind the scenes?

```go
templateName := filepath.Base(pageFile)
parsedTemplate := template.New(templateName).ParseFiles(pageFile)
```

Please explain what happens step by step.

---

### 1. `templateName := filepath.Base(pageFile)`

- **Purpose**: This line extracts the base file name from a full file path.
- **What's happening**:
  - `pageFile` is a string that contains the full path to the template file (e.g., `./templates/home.page.gohtml`).
  - `filepath.Base()` takes this full path and extracts just the base file name. So, for the path `./templates/home.page.gohtml`, it would return `home.page.gohtml`.
  - The result (`home.page.gohtml`) is stored in the variable `templateName`.

- **Why is this important**: This base name (`templateName`) will be used as the identifier for this particular template in the cache. It ensures that the template can be retrieved later using its name.

### 2. `parsedTemplate := template.New(templateName).ParseFiles(pageFile)`

- **Purpose**: This line creates a new template and parses the content of the file specified by `pageFile`.
- **What's happening**:
  - **`template.New(templateName)`**: 
    - This creates a new `*template.Template` instance and assigns it the name `templateName` (e.g., `home.page.gohtml`).
    - `template.Template` is part of Go’s `html/template` package, which provides functions for parsing and executing HTML templates.
    - This new template acts as a container for the template being loaded and associated content.
  - **`.ParseFiles(pageFile)`**:
    - `ParseFiles()` reads the content of the file at `pageFile` (e.g., `./templates/home.page.gohtml`) and associates it with the template instance created in the previous step.
    - It parses the file, meaning it reads the template’s content (which could contain HTML with Go template syntax like `{{ . }}` or `{{ if }}`) and prepares it for execution later.
    - If the file contains valid template syntax, it will be stored inside the `parsedTemplate`. If there's an error in the template file (like a syntax error), `ParseFiles` will return an error.

- **Why is this important**: This step is crucial because it creates a named template and loads the actual content of the file into that template. This parsed template will later be used to execute and render the HTML content, filling in any dynamic data.

### The Process in Summary:
1. **`templateName`** is assigned the base name of the file (like `home.page.gohtml`) so it can be uniquely identified.
2. A new template object is created using **`template.New(templateName)`**.
3. The actual content of the file (`pageFile`) is read and parsed using **`ParseFiles()`**, and that content is associated with the newly created template.

This ensures that Go knows how to process the HTML and Go template syntax inside the file, which will be executed later when rendering the page.

Yes, `filepath.Base()` extracts and returns only the file name (like `home.page.gohtml`) as a string from the given directory path.
