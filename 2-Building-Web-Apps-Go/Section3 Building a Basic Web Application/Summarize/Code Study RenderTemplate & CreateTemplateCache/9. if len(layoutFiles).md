Can you explain how the following code works behind the scenes, specifically focusing on how layout templates are found, checked, and associated with page templates?

```go
layoutFiles, err := filepath.Glob("./templates/*.layout.gohtml")

if len(layoutFiles) > 0 {
    parsedTemplate, err = parsedTemplate.ParseGlob("./templates/*.layout.gohtml")
}
```

Here's how these lines of code work behind the scenes:

1. **`layoutFiles, _ := filepath.Glob("./templates/*.layout.gohtml")`:**
   - This line uses `filepath.Glob` to search the `./templates` directory for any files that match the pattern `*.layout.gohtml`. 
   - It returns a slice of strings where each string is the path to a file that matches the pattern. This slice represents all the layout template files found in the specified directory.

2. **`if len(layoutFiles) > 0 {`**:
   - This condition checks if any layout files were found by examining the length of the `layoutFiles` slice. If it contains one or more files, the block of code inside the `if` statement will be executed.
   - If no layout files are found, the code inside the block is skipped, meaning the page template will not be associated with any layout templates.

3. **`parsedTemplate, _ = parsedTemplate.ParseGlob("./templates/*.layout.gohtml")`:**
   - If layout files are found, this line uses `parsedTemplate.ParseGlob()` to parse and combine all layout templates (`*.layout.gohtml`) with the already parsed page template (`parsedTemplate`).
   - It allows the page template to be wrapped with the layout templates, typically used for common sections like headers and footers.
   - After parsing, the `parsedTemplate` variable is updated to include both the page content and any associated layout templates.

In summary, these lines check for layout templates in the directory and, if found, combine them with the page templates, ensuring that shared layout components (e.g., headers, footers) are consistently included across all pages.
