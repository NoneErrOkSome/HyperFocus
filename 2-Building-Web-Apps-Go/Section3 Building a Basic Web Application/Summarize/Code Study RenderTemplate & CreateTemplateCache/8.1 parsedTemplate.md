To explain how `parsedTemplate := template.New(templateName).ParseFiles(pageFile)` and `parsedTemplate = parsedTemplate.ParseGlob("./templates/*.layout.gohtml")` look internally, let’s break it down step by step.

### First `parsedTemplate` - Parsing the Page File

```go
parsedTemplate := template.New(templateName).ParseFiles(pageFile)
```

1. **`template.New(templateName)`**:  
   This creates a new template object, but it doesn’t yet contain any actual content. The `templateName` string is used to identify this new template. It’s like creating a blank document with a title but no content yet.
   
2. **`ParseFiles(pageFile)`**:  
   The `ParseFiles` function then reads the content of the file specified by `pageFile`. This file is expected to be a Go HTML template, which can contain regular HTML and template directives like `{{ . }}` for dynamic content. The function parses the content of the file and associates it with the newly created `templateName`. Now, the template object `parsedTemplate` contains the parsed content from `pageFile`.

   At this stage, **`parsedTemplate`** looks like this:
   
   - Template Name: `home.page.gohtml` (for example)
   - Parsed Content: HTML structure and template directives (like `{{ . }}` for dynamic content).
   
   So, it's a fully constructed template ready to be executed, but it's only connected to the individual page template (no layout).

### Second `parsedTemplate` - Parsing the Layout File

```go
parsedTemplate = parsedTemplate.ParseGlob("./templates/*.layout.gohtml")
```

1. **`parsedTemplate.ParseGlob()`**:  
   The `ParseGlob` function scans through all files that match the pattern `./templates/*.layout.gohtml`. It reads and parses each of the layout files that match the pattern. These layout files are expected to contain shared HTML structures like headers, footers, and other reusable components that will wrap around the specific content of the page.
   
2. **Combining Templates**:  
   The key here is that the already parsed page template (`parsedTemplate` from step 1) gets "combined" with these layout templates. Essentially, the layouts are parsed and associated with the original page template, so that when the page template is rendered, the layout templates will be applied around it.

   After this step, **`parsedTemplate`** will contain both the parsed content of the individual page (from `pageFile`) **and** the shared layout structure (from `layout.gohtml` files).

### In summary:
- After the first parsing (`ParseFiles`), the template contains the content of an individual page (like `home.page.gohtml`).
- After the second parsing (`ParseGlob`), the same template now also incorporates any shared layout files (like `base.layout.gohtml`), meaning the individual page content will be wrapped with the layout when it’s rendered. 

So visually:

1. **First Parsed Template**: Contains specific page content, e.g., "Home Page" HTML content and placeholders for dynamic content (`{{ . }}`).
   
2. **Second Parsed Template**: Contains both the specific page content *and* the surrounding layout, e.g., the "Home Page" is placed inside a common site layout (header, footer, etc.).

No, **layout templates** in Go are not like CSS. While they both help structure a webpage, they serve different purposes:

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
- **Purpose**: CSS is used to define the visual style of a webpage, such as fonts, colors, layouts (grid/flexbox), margins, and more. It controls how HTML elements appear to the user but **does not control the content** or structure of the HTML itself.
- **Example**: You use CSS to make a page have a blue background, center-align text, or style buttons.

### Layout Templates in Go:
- **Purpose**: Layout templates in Go control the **structure** and **content organization** of a webpage by wrapping shared HTML elements (like a header, footer, or navigation menu) around dynamic content. They provide a skeleton for how multiple pages can share common components while allowing different content to be injected into the middle of the structure.
- **Example**: A Go layout template may define a common header, footer, and navigation bar that should appear on all pages, and it will use the `{{template "content" .}}` directive to include the dynamic content (like the home page or about page) into the middle of the layout.

### Key Differences:
- **CSS**: Deals with how elements **look** (style).
- **Layout templates**: Deal with how HTML content is **structured** and shared between pages, allowing you to avoid repeating the same HTML (like headers or footers) across multiple templates.

### How Layouts Work in Go:
- You typically have a **base layout** (like `base.layout.gohtml`) that contains shared elements such as `<head>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, etc.
- The specific page templates (like `home.page.gohtml`) are "injected" into the layout using Go template syntax (like `{{define "content"}}`).

In short, layouts in Go help **organize content**, while CSS **styles content**. They work together to create a complete, styled, and structured webpage.
