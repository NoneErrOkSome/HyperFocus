The term **comma-ok** refers to the specific syntax used in Go when performing operations that return multiple values, such as checking for the presence of a key in a map. It is called **comma-ok** because the result of the operation involves two values, separated by a comma: the actual value and a boolean flag that indicates whether the operation succeeded.

For example:

```go
templ, found := templateCache[templateName]
```

- The first part (`templ`) is the value stored at `templateName` in the `templateCache`.
- The second part (`found`) is a boolean that is `true` if `templateName` exists in the `templateCache`, and `false` if it doesn't.

This pattern is commonly used when you want to **check if a key exists in a map**, and it's referred to as **comma-ok** because the syntax involves separating the value and the success flag by a comma. 

The "ok" part comes from the fact that the second returned value often answers whether the operation was successful (i.e., "ok").
