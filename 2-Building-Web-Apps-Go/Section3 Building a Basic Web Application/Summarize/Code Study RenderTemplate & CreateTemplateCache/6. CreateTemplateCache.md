Both `make(map[string]*template.Template)` and `map[string]*template.Template{}` are used to create empty maps, but there are subtle differences in how they work:

### 1. **`make(map[string]*template.Template)`**
   - This is the preferred way to create an empty map.
   - The `make()` function allocates and initializes the map, preparing it for use. It ensures that the map is properly allocated and ready for operations like `insert` or `lookup`.
   - This method is more flexible because it allows you to specify an initial capacity for the map if needed, although it's optional.

   ```go
   myMap := make(map[string]*template.Template)
   ```

   Here, `make()` ensures the map is fully initialized and you can start adding key-value pairs to it right away.

### 2. **`map[string]*template.Template{}`**
   - This is a map literal, and it creates an empty map.
   - It is less common than `make()` but functionally equivalent for initializing an empty map.
   - The map is still ready for use, but this method is typically used when you're directly assigning key-value pairs to the map at creation.

   ```go
   myMap := map[string]*template.Template{}
   ```

   This is also an empty map, but it's more commonly used when you want to initialize the map with some initial values:
   ```go
   myMap := map[string]*template.Template{
       "home": someTemplate,
       "about": anotherTemplate,
   }
   ```

### Key Differences:
- **Use of `make()`** is the idiomatic and preferred approach when you need to create an empty map and intend to populate it later, especially when working with maps that could grow or be modified.
- **Use of a literal `{}`** is often used when you're defining a map with initial values, but it works for empty maps as well.

In practice, both will work for creating an empty map. However, `make()` is generally used when you know you'll be adding elements to the map later, while the literal is more commonly used when initializing with specific values.
