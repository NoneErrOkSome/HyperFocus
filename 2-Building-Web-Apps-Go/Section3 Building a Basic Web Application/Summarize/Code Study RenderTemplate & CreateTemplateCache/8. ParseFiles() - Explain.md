Does `ParseFiles()` only read the file, or does it also check if it contains valid template syntax like `{{ }}`? If the file doesn't have valid template syntax, will it return an error?

Yes, `ParseFiles()` does more than just reading the file; it **parses** the content of the file to check for valid Go template syntax, including elements like `{{ }}` (the Go template directives). Here’s a breakdown of its behavior:

### How `ParseFiles()` Works:
1. **File Reading**:
   - It first reads the file content just like any other file reading function would.
   - This includes any kind of file, whether it’s an HTML file, text file, or any file format.

2. **Parsing the File**:
   - After reading, `ParseFiles()` tries to **parse** the content as a Go template.
   - It looks for valid Go template syntax, which includes constructs like `{{ . }}`, `{{ if }}`, `{{ range }}`, and more.

3. **Validation of Template Syntax**:
   - If the file contains valid Go template syntax or just plain HTML without template directives, it will be successfully parsed.
   - If the file has incorrect Go template syntax (e.g., unbalanced `{{ }}`, wrong expressions inside `{{ }}`), `ParseFiles()` will return an error.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If the file does not contain valid Go template syntax, `ParseFiles()` returns an error. This can happen if:
     - There’s a syntax error in the template directives (like `{{ }}`).
     - The file format is not as expected (e.g., it’s not structured in a way that can be parsed as a Go template).

### Important Points:
- **Plain HTML** (without `{{ }}` directives) can be parsed successfully because it’s still valid content for a Go template. The template system just won’t insert any dynamic data in that case.
- If the file has **Go template syntax errors**, `ParseFiles()` will return an error, signaling that the file cannot be processed as a valid template.

In short, `ParseFiles()` ensures that the file can be interpreted as a valid Go template and checks for any errors in the template syntax. If there’s a problem, it will return an error, allowing you to handle that case (e.g., logging the error or returning an appropriate HTTP response).
