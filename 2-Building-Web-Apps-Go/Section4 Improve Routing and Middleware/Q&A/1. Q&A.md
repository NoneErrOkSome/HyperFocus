Routing in a web application is like managing a **postal delivery system**:

1. **Router**: Acts like the **post office**, deciding where each request (like a letter) should go based on its address (URL).
    
    - Example: `/home` is sent to the **Home Handler**, and `/about` goes to the **About Handler**.
2. **Routes**: These are the **addresses** on the envelopes (URL patterns) that match specific handlers.
    
    - Example: A route `/user/{id}` handles all "user" requests, and `{id}` is the recipient's unique name.
3. **Handler Functions**: These are the **people at the address** who open the letter (process the request) and write a reply (response).
    
    - Example: A handler for `/contact` might read the sender's details and send back a "Thank you" note.
4. **Middleware**: Like a **postal inspector**, middleware checks, logs, or modifies the letter before it reaches the recipient (e.g., verifying identity or adding stamps).
    
5. **HTTP Methods**: Think of methods as the **type of delivery**â€”standard mail (GET), registered mail (POST), etc. The same address may handle different types of deliveries.
    
6. **Query and Parameters**: These are **extra notes on the envelope**, such as "Urgent" or "Handle with Care," providing additional instructions for the recipient.

### Example:

If someone sends a letter to `/about` (GET), the **router** reads the address, hands it to the **About Handler** (person at the `/about` house), and they reply with a brief introduction.

This process ensures every request (letter) reaches the right place and gets a proper response.
