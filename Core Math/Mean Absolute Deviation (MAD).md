Got it! Let me rewrite the explanation using `$ ... $` for math notation. Here's the updated version:

### Steps to Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD):

1. **Find the mean (average) of the dataset**:
   - Add up all the data points.
   - Divide the sum by the number of data points.

   Formula:  
   $\text{Mean} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}$  
   Where:
   - $x_i$ = each data point
   - $n$ = total number of data points

2. **Calculate the absolute deviation for each data point**:
   - Subtract the mean from each data point.
   - Take the absolute value of the result.

   Formula:  
   $\text{Absolute Deviation} = |x_i - \text{Mean}|$

3. **Find the mean of the absolute deviations**:
   - Add up all the absolute deviations.
   - Divide the sum by the number of data points.

   Formula:  
   $\text{MAD} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - \text{Mean}|}{n}$

### Example:

Consider the dataset: $\{2, 4, 6, 8\}$.

1. **Calculate the mean**:
   - Sum of data points = $2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20$
   - Number of data points = $4$
   - Mean = $\frac{20}{4} = 5$

2. **Calculate absolute deviations**:
   - $|2 - 5| = 3$
   - $|4 - 5| = 1$
   - $|6 - 5| = 1$
   - $|8 - 5| = 3$

3. **Calculate MAD**:
   - Sum of absolute deviations = $3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8$
   - MAD = $\frac{8}{4} = 2$

So, the Mean Absolute Deviation is **2**.

### Key Notes:
- MAD measures the average distance between each data point and the mean.
- It is less sensitive to outliers compared to standard deviation.
- MAD is always a non-negative value.
