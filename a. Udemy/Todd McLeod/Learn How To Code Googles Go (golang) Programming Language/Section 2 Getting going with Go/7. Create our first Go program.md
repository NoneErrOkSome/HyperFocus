Okay, let's write our first Go program and understand its basic structure. We'll typically use the online Golang Playground to easily get started. The goal is to print a simple message, like "Hello, gophers!".

Here's the code:

Go

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// This line declares the package as "main".
	// An executable Go program must belong to the "main" package.
	// Packages are used to organize code.

	// This line imports the "fmt" package from Go's standard library.
	// The "fmt" package provides functions for formatted I/O (input/output),
	// such as printing text to the console.

	// This is the main function, where program execution begins.
	// Every executable Go program must have a main function inside the main package.

	// The code inside the curly braces {} is the body of the main function.

	// fmt.Println() is a function from the imported "fmt" package.
	// It prints the given arguments to the standard output (console)
	// followed by a newline character.
	fmt.Println("Hello, gophers!")

	// Comments in Go start with "//" for single-line comments
	// or are enclosed in "/* */" for multi-line comments.
	/*
		This is a multi-line comment.
		It can span across multiple lines.
	*/
}

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`package main`**: This line is essential for any Go program that you want to compile into an executable file. It signifies that this code belongs to the `main` package, which is the entry point for execution.
2. **`import "fmt"`**: This imports the "fmt" (format) package. Go's standard library is organized into packages, and `fmt` contains functions for formatted input and output, like printing to the console.
3. **`func main()`**: This defines the main function. In an executable `main` package, the `main` function is where your program starts running.
4. **`{ ... }`**: The curly braces define the body of the `main` function, containing the instructions to be executed.
5. **`fmt.Println("Hello, gophers!")`**: This is the core instruction. It calls the `Println` function from the `fmt` package. The string `"Hello, gophers!"` is passed as an argument, and `Println` displays this text on the console, followed by a newline.
6. **Comments (`//` and `/* */`)**: These lines are notes for humans reading the code and are ignored by the Go compiler. They are used to explain what the code does.

When you run this code (for example, by clicking "Run" on the Golang Playground), it will print "Hello, gophers!" to the output area. This simple program demonstrates the fundamental structure needed to get started with Go.
