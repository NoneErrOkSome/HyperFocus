### **What is Unicast?**

**Unicast** is a **one-to-one communication method** where data is sent from a **single sender to a single recipient** over a network.

This is the most **common type of network communication**, used in applications like **web browsing, emails, and file downloads**.

## **1. How Unicast Works**

1. A **sender** transmits data to a **specific destination IP address**.
2. The **recipient** receives and processes the data.
3. **Each communication session is independent**, meaning multiple unicast transmissions require **separate data streams**.

‚úÖ **Example:**

- When you visit a website (`www.example.com`), your browser sends a **unicast request** to the web server.
- The server **sends a unicast response** back to your device with the webpage content.

## **2. Unicast vs. Broadcast vs. Multicast**

- **Unicast:** One sender ‚Üí One receiver (e.g., loading a webpage).
- **Broadcast:** One sender ‚Üí All devices in the network (e.g., DHCP discovery).
- **Multicast:** One sender ‚Üí Multiple subscribed receivers (e.g., live video streaming).

‚úÖ **Unicast is private and secure since data is sent only to the intended recipient.**  
‚ùå **Unicast can be inefficient for large-scale data distribution (e.g., sending the same video to 1,000 users requires 1,000 separate streams).**

## **3. Where is Unicast Used?**

- **Web browsing (HTTP, HTTPS)** ‚Äì Loading a website.
- **Email (SMTP, IMAP, POP3)** ‚Äì Sending and receiving emails.
- **File downloads (FTP, HTTP)** ‚Äì Downloading a document or software.
- **VoIP calls (SIP, RTP)** ‚Äì Direct voice communication between two people.
- **Streaming services (Netflix, YouTube on-demand)** ‚Äì Streaming content to a single user.

‚úÖ **Unicast is the default communication method on the internet.**

## **4. How Unicast Traffic is Routed**

1. A device sends **a packet with a specific destination IP address**.
2. The **router examines the destination address** and forwards it toward the recipient.
3. The **destination device receives and processes the data**.

‚úÖ **Routers only forward unicast packets to the intended recipient, unlike broadcast, which floods the network.**

## **5. Key Takeaways**

1. **Unicast is a one-to-one communication model.**
2. **It is used in web browsing, emails, file transfers, and VoIP calls.**
3. **It is private and efficient for individual communications.**
4. **Unicast requires separate data streams for multiple recipients, which can increase bandwidth usage.**
5. **It is the most common type of network traffic on the internet.**

üöÄ **Unicast is the foundation of modern networking, ensuring direct and reliable communication between devices!**
