### **What is Multicast?**

**Multicast** is a method of communication where a single sender transmits data to **multiple recipients at the same time**, but only to **devices that have requested to receive it**.

Unlike **unicast**, which sends separate copies of data to each recipient, **multicast sends a single copy that is distributed to multiple devices**, reducing bandwidth usage and improving network efficiency.

## **1. How Multicast Works**

1. **A sender transmits data to a multicast IP address** (e.g., `239.0.0.1`).
2. **Interested devices "subscribe" to that multicast group**.
3. **Routers forward the multicast traffic only to networks where subscribed devices exist**.
4. **Devices that have not joined the multicast group do not receive the data**.

âœ… **Example:**  
A video streaming server sends a live broadcast to multiple users.

- With **unicast**, the server must send **a separate video stream to each user**.
- With **multicast**, the server sends **one video stream to a multicast address**, and all users subscribed to that multicast group receive the same stream.

## **2. Multicast vs. Unicast vs. Broadcast**

- **Unicast:** One-to-one communication (e.g., a direct video call).
- **Broadcast:** One-to-all communication (e.g., a DHCP request sent to all devices on a network).
- **Multicast:** One-to-many communication (e.g., live video streaming to multiple users).

âœ… **Multicast is more efficient than unicast because it reduces duplicate data transmissions**.  
âœ… **Multicast is better than broadcast because it only sends data to interested recipients**.

## **3. Multicast IP Address Range**

Multicast uses **Class D IP addresses** ranging from **224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255**.

- **224.0.0.0 â€“ 224.0.0.255** â†’ Reserved for local network multicast (e.g., OSPF routing).
- **239.0.0.0 â€“ 239.255.255.255** â†’ Private multicast addresses (not used on the internet).

## **4. Where is Multicast Used?**

- **Live video streaming (IPTV, YouTube Live, webinars).**
- **Online gaming (game state updates sent to multiple players).**
- **Financial stock market updates.**
- **Routing protocols (OSPF, EIGRP) for efficient data exchange.**

âœ… **Multicast reduces network congestion and is used for high-bandwidth applications**.

## **5. How Devices Subscribe to Multicast**

Devices use **IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol)** to join and leave multicast groups.

- A device sends an **IGMP Join message** to a multicast router to subscribe.
- The router **forwards multicast traffic only to networks with active subscribers**.

âœ… **Routers only send multicast traffic where it is needed, preventing unnecessary congestion.**

### **6. Key Takeaways**

1. **Multicast is a one-to-many communication method that saves bandwidth.**
2. **It is more efficient than unicast (reduces duplicate data transmissions).**
3. **It is better than broadcast (only reaches interested devices).**
4. **It uses Class D IP addresses (224.0.0.0 â€“ 239.255.255.255).**
5. **IGMP is used for joining/leaving multicast groups.**

ðŸš€ **Multicast is essential for efficient video streaming, gaming, and large-scale data distribution!**
