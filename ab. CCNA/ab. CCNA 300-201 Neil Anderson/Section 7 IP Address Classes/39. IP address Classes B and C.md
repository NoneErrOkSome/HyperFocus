### **Detailed Summary of IPv4 Address Classes (Class A, B, C) and Private Addresses**

---

## **1. Recap of Class A Addresses**

Previously, we covered **Class A addresses**, which are used for **large networks** with a **default subnet mask of /8 (255.0.0.0)**. These addresses range from **1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0**, allowing **126 networks** with **16 million+ hosts per network**. However, certain addresses are **reserved**, such as **127.0.0.0/8**, which is used for **loopback testing**.

---

## **2. Class B Addresses (Medium to Large Networks)**

- **Class B addresses were designed for medium to large-sized organizations.**
- The **first two bits** of a Class B address are **always set to `10` in binary**.
- The **default subnet mask for Class B is /16** (255.255.0.0), meaning that the first **two octets** represent the **network portion**, and the last **two octets** are available for **host assignments**.
- The **valid address range** for Class B networks is **128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0**.

### **Network and Host Capacity in Class B**

- **Class B networks allow for a total of 16,384 networks** (2¬π‚Å¥ networks).
- Each network can have **up to 65,534 hosts** (2¬π‚Å∂ - 2).
- The **two reserved addresses** per network are:
    - **Network Address (all 0s in the host portion)**
    - **Broadcast Address (all 1s in the host portion)**

### **Subnetting Class B**

- Even though **Class B can support up to 65,534 hosts per network**, this is **not practical** in real-world deployments due to performance and security concerns.
- A **Class B address is usually subnetted into smaller subnets** to **improve efficiency and organization**.

Example:

- A company assigned **172.16.0.0/16** could divide it into **smaller /24 subnets** such as:
    - `172.16.1.0/24` ‚Üí Sales Department
    - `172.16.2.0/24` ‚Üí Accounting Department
    - `172.16.3.0/24` ‚Üí IT Department

## **3. Class C Addresses (Small Networks)**

- **Class C addresses were designed for small networks** such as small businesses and home networks.
- The **first three bits** of a Class C address are **always set to `110` in binary**.
- The **default subnet mask for Class C is /24** (255.255.255.0), meaning the **first three octets represent the network portion**, and the **last octet is used for host assignments**.
- The **valid address range** for Class C networks is **192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0**.

### **Network and Host Capacity in Class C**

- **Class C supports over 2 million networks** (2¬≤¬π networks).
- Each network can have **up to 254 usable hosts** (2‚Å∏ - 2).
- The **two reserved addresses** per network are:
    - **Network Address (e.g., 192.168.1.0)**
    - **Broadcast Address (e.g., 192.168.1.255)**

### **Subnetting Class C**

- Since **Class C networks have only 254 usable hosts**, they **can be used as-is** or further **subnetted into smaller networks** when necessary.
- Unlike **Class A and B**, **Class C is often assigned to organizations as a single /24 network** without requiring additional subnetting.

Example:

- A company with **192.168.10.0/24** could divide it into **smaller subnets**:
    - `192.168.10.0/26` ‚Üí 62 hosts
    - `192.168.10.64/26` ‚Üí 62 hosts
    - `192.168.10.128/26` ‚Üí 62 hosts

## **4. Private IP Addresses (Non-Routable on the Internet)**

- **Some IP address ranges are reserved for private networks** and **cannot be used on the public internet**.
- These **private IP addresses** allow organizations to **use internal IPs freely without requiring unique public IPs**.
- **Private IPs are used in combination with NAT (Network Address Translation) to allow internet access.**

### **Private IP Ranges in Each Class**

- **Class A:** `10.0.0.0 ‚Äì 10.255.255.255`
- **Class B:** `172.16.0.0 ‚Äì 172.31.255.255`
- **Class C:** `192.168.0.0 ‚Äì 192.168.255.255`

‚úÖ **These private addresses are commonly used in homes, businesses, and internal networks.**

---

## **5. Why Were Private IPs Introduced?**

- Originally, **every device needed a unique public IP**.
- **IPv4 exhaustion** made this **impossible**, as **there were not enough public IPs** for every device.
- **Solution:** Private IPs + NAT allow multiple devices in a **private network to share a single public IP**.

### **Example of Private IP Usage**

- **Home Network Example (192.168.1.0/24)**
    - **Router Public IP:** `203.0.113.5`
    - **Private IPs Assigned via DHCP:**
        - Laptop: `192.168.1.10`
        - Phone: `192.168.1.11`
        - Printer: `192.168.1.20`
    - **Router translates these private IPs to its public IP** when connecting to the internet.

## **6. Key Takeaways**

- **Class B** was designed for **medium to large networks**, uses a **/16 subnet mask**, and supports **16,384 networks and 65,534 hosts per network**.
- **Class C** was designed for **small networks**, uses a **/24 subnet mask**, and supports **over 2 million networks with 254 hosts each**.
- **Private IP addresses** exist to allow organizations to **use internal IPs that are not routable on the internet**.
- **NAT (Network Address Translation) allows private IPs to access the internet using a shared public IP**.
- **IPv4 was not designed for the modern internet**, which led to **IPv4 exhaustion and the eventual need for IPv6**.

Understanding **IPv4 address classes and subnetting** is **critical** for network design, troubleshooting, and ensuring efficient IP address management. üöÄ
