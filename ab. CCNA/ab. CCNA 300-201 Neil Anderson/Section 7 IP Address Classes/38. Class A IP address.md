### **Simplified Notes on IPv4 Address Classes (Class A, B, C)**

---

### **1. What Are IP Address Classes?**

- **IPv4 addresses were originally divided into classes (A, B, C, D, E)**.
- Used to **allocate addresses based on network size**.
- **Classes A, B, and C** are used for **hosts**.
- **Classes D and E** (covered later) are for **multicast and experimental use**.

---

### **2. How IPv4 Address Classes Work**

- **Each class has a default subnet mask** that determines how many **network and host bits** it has.
- **More network bits** = More networks, but **fewer hosts per network**.
- **More host bits** = Fewer networks, but **more hosts per network**.

|**Class**|**Network Bits**|**Host Bits**|**Subnet Mask**|**IP Range**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**A**|8|24|`255.0.0.0` (`/8`)|`1.0.0.0 â€“ 126.0.0.0`|
|**B**|16|16|`255.255.0.0` (`/16`)|`128.0.0.0 â€“ 191.255.0.0`|
|**C**|24|8|`255.255.255.0` (`/24`)|`192.0.0.0 â€“ 223.255.255.0`|

### **3. Class A Addresses (Large Networks)**

- **Used for huge organizations and ISPs**.
- The **first bit is always 0**, meaning addresses **start from 1 to 126**.
- **Example:**
    - Network: `10.0.0.0/8`
    - First usable host: `10.0.0.1`
    - Last usable host: `10.255.255.254`
    - Broadcast: `10.255.255.255`

ðŸš« **127.0.0.0 â€“ 127.255.255.255 is reserved** for **loopback testing**.  
ðŸš« **0.0.0.0 â€“ 0.255.255.255 is reserved** for **special use**.

### **4. Class B Addresses (Medium-Sized Networks)**

- **Used for universities, corporations, and government agencies**.
- The **first two bits are always 10**, meaning addresses **start from 128 to 191**.
- **Example:**
    - Network: `172.16.0.0/16`
    - First usable host: `172.16.0.1`
    - Last usable host: `172.16.255.254`
    - Broadcast: `172.16.255.255`

---

### **5. Class C Addresses (Small Networks)**

- **Used for home networks and small businesses**.
- The **first three bits are always 110**, meaning addresses **start from 192 to 223**.
- **Example:**
    - Network: `192.168.1.0/24`
    - First usable host: `192.168.1.1`
    - Last usable host: `192.168.1.254`
    - Broadcast: `192.168.1.255`

### **6. Issues With IPv4 Addressing**

- **IPv4 ran out of addresses** because designers **didnâ€™t expect the internet to grow so large**.
- **Solutions:**  
    âœ… **IPv6** (128-bit addresses)  
    âœ… **Private IP addresses & NAT (Network Address Translation)**  
    âœ… **Subnetting to split large networks into smaller ones**

---

### **7. Key Takeaways**

âœ… **Class A = Few networks, many hosts** (`/8`).  
âœ… **Class B = Medium networks, medium hosts** (`/16`).  
âœ… **Class C = Many networks, few hosts** (`/24`).  
âœ… **IPv4 exhaustion led to the creation of IPv6, NAT, and subnetting**.  
âœ… **Subnetting is used to divide large networks into smaller, more manageable subnets**.

This is essential knowledge for **network design, IP planning, and subnetting**. ðŸš€
