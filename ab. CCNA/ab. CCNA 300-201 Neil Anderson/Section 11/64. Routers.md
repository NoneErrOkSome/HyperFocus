# 🌐 Routers vs Switches – Routing Between IP Subnets

Routers and switches both play essential roles in a network—but **they operate at different layers** of the OSI model and are used for different purposes. This lecture focuses on how routers function, how they differ from switches, and when each is required in a network environment.

---

## 🧭 What Do Routers Do?

- **Routers** are used to **connect different IP subnets**.
- Their core job is to **route packets from one network to another**.
- This process is called **inter-network communication**, and routers are essential for it.

💡 Example: If you want to send traffic from `192.168.1.0/24` to `192.168.2.0/24`, **you need a router**.

## 🧱 Routers in the OSI Model

|OSI Layer|Router Role|
|---|---|
|**Layer 3**|Primary role – Routing via IP addressing|
|Layer 2|Understands MAC addresses (next hop)|
|Layer 1|Physical interfaces (Ethernet, Serial, etc.)|
|Layers 4–7|Often supported for advanced features (QoS, NAT, ACLs, DPI, etc.)|

✅ But when routing IP traffic, routers are considered **Layer 3 devices**.

---

## 🔁 Comparing Routers and Switches

|Feature|**Router**|**Switch**|
|---|---|---|
|OSI Layer|Layer 3|Layer 2|
|Purpose|Routes traffic between subnets|Forwards traffic within a subnet|
|Interface Types|Ethernet, Serial, ADSL, ISDN, etc.|Ethernet only|
|Broadcast Traffic|Does **not** forward by default|Forwards broadcast frames|
|Number of Ports|Few (2–4 typically)|Many (24, 48, or more)|
|Layer 3 Aware|✅ Yes|❌ Not by default (unless L3 switch)|

---

## 🔌 Interface Example: Router vs Switch

- A **Cisco Catalyst 2960 switch** might have **48 Ethernet ports**, ideal for connecting many devices on a LAN.
- A **Cisco 2800 series router** typically has:
    - **2 built-in Ethernet ports**
    - A **console port** and **auxiliary port**
    - **Modular slots** for adding additional interfaces: ADSL, serial, etc.

➡️ Routers are **versatile in WAN and non-Ethernet connections**, while switches are **built for Ethernet-based LANs**.

## 🖥️ Switch Recap: When a Router Is _Not_ Needed

### Scenario:

- All hosts on subnet `10.10.10.0/24`
- All hosts connected to switches only

✅ All hosts can **communicate freely**  
❌ **No router is required**

---

## 🚧 But What Happens With Multiple Subnets?

### New Scenario:

- One host is assigned `10.10.11.10/24`
- All others remain on `10.10.10.0/24`

Now we have **two IP subnets**:

- `10.10.10.0/24`
- `10.10.11.0/24`

❌ Switches **cannot route between them**  
✅ You now **need a router** to enable communication across subnets

---

## 🔄 What About Layer 3 Switches?

A **Layer 3 switch** is a switch that also performs **routing**.

### Features:

- Can route between subnets on the LAN
- Still has high port count and Ethernet-only interfaces
- Usually supports faster internal switching speeds than routers

🧠 These devices are Layer 2 + Layer 3 aware. They operate just like a normal switch **within a subnet**, but can also route between **multiple VLANs or subnets**.

📈 In the past, Layer 3 switches were expensive—but today, models like the **Catalyst 2960** have affordable routing capabilities.

---

## 🛰️ When Do You Still Need a Router?

Even with Layer 3 switches on your LAN, a **traditional router is still required** when:

- You need to connect to **non-Ethernet WAN links** (e.g., ADSL, Serial)
- You need advanced **Layer 3–7 features** (e.g., NAT, firewall, VPN termination)

---

## 🧠 Summary: When to Use What

|Use Case|Device Required|
|---|---|
|Devices on the **same subnet**|Switch only|
|Devices on **different subnets (LAN)**|Layer 3 Switch or Router|
|Devices on **different subnets (WAN)**|Router with WAN interfaces|
|**Advanced packet filtering or NAT**|Router or firewall device|
