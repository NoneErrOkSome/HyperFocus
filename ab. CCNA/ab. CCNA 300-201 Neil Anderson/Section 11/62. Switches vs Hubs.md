Here's a structured and detailed deep dive into the **basics of hubs vs. switches**, based entirely on your lecture content:

# 🖧 Hubs vs. Switches – Layer 1 and Layer 2 Devices

Hubs and switches are both used to **connect multiple devices** (like PCs, printers, and servers) on a Local Area Network (LAN). Although they perform similar physical roles, they behave very differently when it comes to handling traffic.

---

## 🔌 Basic Role of Hubs and Switches

- **End hosts** (like PCs, printers) connect to either a **hub or a switch** via **Ethernet cables**.
- This allows them to communicate with one another within the same LAN.
- Devices plug into individual ports on the hub or switch.

🖼 Example: A Cisco Catalyst 2960 switch with **48 ports** allows up to 48 end devices to be directly connected.

---

## 🧯 What Happens If You Need More Than 48 Hosts?

If you have more hosts than a single switch can handle:

- You deploy **multiple switches**.
- Connect switches using **inter-switch links** (Ethernet cables between switches).
- This creates a larger, scalable LAN topology.

## 🪛 Hubs: How They Work (Layer 1)

### 🔁 Half-Duplex Only

- Devices **can either send or receive** data at a time—**not both**.

### 🔄 Shared Collision Domain

- All ports **share the same bandwidth**.
- If two devices send at once, a **collision** happens.
- Devices detect this and back off using:
    - **CSMA/CD** (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection).

### 🚫 No Intelligence

- Hubs are **Layer 1 devices**.
- They don’t inspect the frame or MAC address.
- When a frame is received, the hub:
    - **Broadcasts it to all other ports**.
    - All devices must inspect the frame—even if it's not meant for them.

🛑 **Downside**:

- Inefficient
- Poor security
- High risk of collisions
- Outdated and **no longer used**

---

## 🔁 Switches: How They Work (Layer 2)

### 🔄 Full-Duplex (Typically)

- Devices can **send and receive simultaneously**.
- Much more efficient and eliminates collisions.

### 🧠 MAC Address Awareness

- Switches operate at **Layer 2**, and also at Layer 1 (physical ports).
- They **inspect the Ethernet frame's source MAC address**.
- They build a **MAC address table** mapping:
    - MAC Address → Switch Port

### 🎯 Intelligent Forwarding

- When a unicast frame arrives:
    - The switch **looks up the destination MAC**.
    - Forwards the frame **only to the correct port**.
- When the MAC is unknown or it’s a **broadcast**:
    - The frame is **flooded** to all other ports (except the one it came in on).

### ✅ Benefits:

- **Each device has its own collision domain**
- **No collisions**
- **Efficient bandwidth usage**
- **Improved security** (frames aren’t shared with unrelated devices)

## ⚖️ Hubs vs. Switches Summary Table

|Feature|Hub|Switch|
|---|---|---|
|OSI Layer|Layer 1|Layer 2 (and Layer 1)|
|Duplex Mode|Half-duplex only|Full-duplex (typically)|
|Collision Domain|One shared domain|One per port (dedicated)|
|Frame Forwarding|Broadcasts to all ports|Forwards to specific port|
|MAC Address Learning|❌ Not supported|✅ Maintains MAC address table|
|Collision Handling|Uses CSMA/CD|No collisions in full-duplex|
|Performance|Low|High|
|Security|Weak (everyone sees traffic)|Strong (isolated forwarding)|
|Modern Use|❌ Obsolete|✅ Standard in all networks|

## 🏁 Final Notes

- **Hubs** are now outdated and have been **replaced entirely by switches**.
- Originally, hubs were used because **switches were too expensive**.
- Today, switches are **affordable and standard**, even for small networks.
- The focus from this point forward in the course will be **exclusively on switches**.
