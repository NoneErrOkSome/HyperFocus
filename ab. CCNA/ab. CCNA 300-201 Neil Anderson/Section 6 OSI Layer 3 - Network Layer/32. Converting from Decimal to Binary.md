# **Deep Dive into Decimal to Binary Conversion**

---

## **1. Introduction to Decimal and Binary Number Systems**

Computers and networks operate using **binary numbers (0s and 1s)**, but humans naturally think in **decimal numbers (0-9)**. **IP addresses**, while written in decimal, are actually understood and processed in **binary format**.

To properly understand **subnetting, IP addressing, and network segmentation**, it's essential to grasp how **decimal numbers are converted into binary**. This knowledge becomes **critical for network engineers**, especially when designing and troubleshooting IP networks.

## **2. Understanding Decimal Number System (Base-10)**

The **decimal system** is the **base-10 numbering system** used in everyday life.

- Each digit has **10 possible values** (0 to 9).
- The **place values increase by powers of 10** as you move left.

For example, the number **236** in decimal is structured as follows:

|1000's|100's|10's|1's|
|---|---|---|---|
|0|2|3|6|

This means:

236=(2×100)+(3×10)+(6×1)236 = (2 \times 100) + (3 \times 10) + (6 \times 1)

Each position represents a **power of 10**, such as:

- **10⁰ = 1**
- **10¹ = 10**
- **10² = 100**
- **10³ = 1000**, and so on.

## **3. Understanding Binary Number System (Base-2)**

The **binary system** is the **base-2 numbering system** used by computers.

- Each digit in binary has **only two possible values: 0 or 1**.
- The **place values increase by powers of 2** instead of 10.

For example, in the binary system:

|128|64|32|16|8|4|2|1|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|1|1|0|1|1|0|0|

Each column represents a **power of 2**:

- **2⁰ = 1**
- **2¹ = 2**
- **2² = 4**
- **2³ = 8**
- **2⁴ = 16**
- **2⁵ = 32**
- **2⁶ = 64**
- **2⁷ = 128**, etc.

This means:

236=(1×128)+(1×64)+(1×32)+(0×16)+(1×8)+(1×4)+(0×2)+(0×1)236 = (1 \times 128) + (1 \times 64) + (1 \times 32) + (0 \times 16) + (1 \times 8) + (1 \times 4) + (0 \times 2) + (0 \times 1)

So, **236 in binary is `11101100`**.

## **4. Step-by-Step Conversion from Decimal to Binary**

To **convert a decimal number to binary**, follow these steps:

### **Example 1: Converting 236 to Binary**

#### **Step 1: Identify the largest power of 2 in 236**

|Power of 2|Value|Fits into 236?|Binary (1 or 0)|Remaining Value|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**2⁷**|**128**|✅ Yes|**1**|**236 - 128 = 108**|
|**2⁶**|**64**|✅ Yes|**1**|**108 - 64 = 44**|
|**2⁵**|**32**|✅ Yes|**1**|**44 - 32 = 12**|
|**2⁴**|**16**|❌ No|**0**|**12 remains**|
|**2³**|**8**|✅ Yes|**1**|**12 - 8 = 4**|
|**2²**|**4**|✅ Yes|**1**|**4 - 4 = 0**|
|**2¹**|**2**|❌ No|**0**|**0 remains**|
|**2⁰**|**1**|❌ No|**0**|**0 remains**|

Thus, **236 in binary is `11101100`**.

✅ **Final Check:** Add up all the values where binary is `1`:

128+64+32+8+4=236128 + 64 + 32 + 8 + 4 = 236

Since this matches our original number, our conversion is correct.

### **Example 2: Converting 179 to Binary**

#### **Step 1: Identify the largest power of 2 in 179**

|Power of 2|Value|Fits into 179?|Binary (1 or 0)|Remaining Value|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**2⁷**|**128**|✅ Yes|**1**|**179 - 128 = 51**|
|**2⁶**|**64**|❌ No|**0**|**51 remains**|
|**2⁵**|**32**|✅ Yes|**1**|**51 - 32 = 19**|
|**2⁴**|**16**|✅ Yes|**1**|**19 - 16 = 3**|
|**2³**|**8**|❌ No|**0**|**3 remains**|
|**2²**|**4**|❌ No|**0**|**3 remains**|
|**2¹**|**2**|✅ Yes|**1**|**3 - 2 = 1**|
|**2⁰**|**1**|✅ Yes|**1**|**1 - 1 = 0**|

Thus, **179 in binary is `10110011`**.

✅ **Final Check:** Add up all the values where binary is `1`:

128+32+16+2+1=179128 + 32 + 16 + 2 + 1 = 179

The result confirms our conversion.

## **5. Why is Binary Important for IP Addresses?**

- **IP addresses (IPv4) are 32-bit binary numbers**, written in decimal for human readability.
- Each **octet (8 bits) of an IP address** represents a decimal number between **0-255**.
- **Subnetting, network segmentation, and host identification** all rely on binary manipulation.

### **Example: Binary Representation of an IP Address**

Consider **192.168.1.1**  
Each **decimal octet** is converted to **binary**:

|Decimal|Binary|
|---|---|
|192|11000000|
|168|10101000|
|1|00000001|
|1|00000001|

Thus, `192.168.1.1` in binary is:  
`11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001`

Network engineers **use binary calculations for subnet masks, CIDR notation, and IP range calculations**.

## **6. Practical Applications of Binary in Networking**

- **Subnetting & Network Design**: Binary is essential to understand **how IP addresses are divided into subnets**.
- **Routing & Packet Filtering**: Routers determine if a packet **stays in the subnet or gets forwarded** by checking the **binary subnet mask**.
- **Access Control**: Firewalls **analyze binary IP addresses** to enforce security rules.
- **Efficient Use of IP Addressing**: CIDR notation (e.g., `/24`) represents **binary subnet masks** to optimize address allocation.

## **7. Conclusion**

- The **binary system is the foundation** of how computers and networks function.
- **IP addressing and subnetting** rely on **binary conversion** for proper routing and network segmentation.
- Understanding **how decimal and binary interact** is **critical for networking professionals**.
- **Subnet masks, CIDR notation, and IP address assignments all require binary calculations**.
