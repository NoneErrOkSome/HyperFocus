### **Detailed Summary of IPv4 Address Format and Configuration**

---

### **1. Understanding IPv4 Address Format**

- An **IPv4 address is a 32-bit number** that uniquely identifies a device on a network.
- It is written in **dotted decimal format**, divided into **four octets** separated by dots (`.`).
- **Example of an IPv4 address:**
    
    ```
    192.168.10.15
    ```
    
    - **192** is the first octet
    - **168** is the second octet
    - **10** is the third octet
    - **15** is the fourth octet
- Each **octet is 8 bits long**, making the total IPv4 address **32 bits** (`8 √ó 4 = 32`).

### **2. Finding Your IP Address on Different Systems**

Every device on a network has an IP address, which can be checked using different commands based on the system:

#### **Windows: Using `ipconfig`**

- Open **Command Prompt (CMD)** and type:
    
    ```bash
    ipconfig
    ```
    
- Example Output:
    
    ```
    IPv4 Address: 192.168.1.9  
    Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0  
    Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1  
    ```
    
- The **default gateway** (e.g., `192.168.1.1`) is the **router that connects the device to other networks**.

#### **Linux: Using `ifconfig` or `ip addr`**

- Open **Terminal** and type:
    
    ```bash
    ifconfig
    ```
    
    or (on newer Linux systems):
    
    ```bash
    ip addr show
    ```
    
- Example Output:
    
    ```
    inet 172.23.4.2  netmask 255.255.255.0
    ```
    
- To check the **default gateway**:
    
    ```bash
    ip route
    ```
    
- Example Output:
    
    ```
    default via 172.23.4.254 dev eth0
    ```
    

#### **Cisco Router/Switch: Using `show ip interface brief`**

- Access the router via **SSH or Console**, then enter:
    
    ```bash
    enable
    show ip interface brief
    ```
    
- Example Output:
    
    ```
    Interface        IP-Address        OK?   Method  Status  
    FastEthernet0/0  192.168.10.1      YES   manual  up  
    ```
    
- To see **more details (including subnet mask)**:
    
    ```bash
    show ip interface FastEthernet0/0
    ```
    
- Example Output:
    
    ```
    Internet Address is 192.168.10.1/24
    ```

### **3. Understanding Subnets and Routing**

- A **subnet** groups devices logically within a network.
- Devices in **the same subnet communicate directly**.
- Devices in **different subnets communicate via a router**.

**Example:**

- **Device 1:** `192.168.1.9/24`
- **Device 2:** `192.168.1.20/24`  
    ‚úÖ **Can communicate directly**
- **Device 3:** `192.168.2.10/24`  
    ‚ùå **Needs a router to communicate with devices in 192.168.1.0/24**

---

### **4. Static vs. Dynamic IP Addressing**

IP addresses can be assigned in **two ways**:

#### **Static IP Address (Manually Assigned)**

- Used for **servers, routers, printers, and infrastructure devices**.
- Ensures **permanent and predictable network assignments**.
- **Example configuration in Windows:**
    - Go to **Network Settings ‚Üí IPv4 Properties**
    - Manually enter:
        
        ```
        IP Address: 192.168.1.100
        Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
        Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1
        ```
        

#### **Dynamic IP Address (Assigned via DHCP)**

- Automatically assigned by a **DHCP server**.
- Used for **PCs, laptops, mobile devices** to **simplify management**.
- **Example: Renewing DHCP Lease in Windows**:
    
    ```bash
    ipconfig /release
    ipconfig /renew
    ```
    

**Why Use DHCP?**

- **Easier management** in large networks (e.g., office with 6000 users).
- **Prevents IP conflicts** by ensuring unique assignments.
- **Centralized control** via a DHCP server.

### **5. Why IPv4 Addresses Are Represented in Binary**

- Computers process IP addresses in **binary (1s and 0s)**, not decimal.
- **Binary helps define subnets and network boundaries**.

**Example:**

- `192.168.10.15` in **binary**:
    
    ```
    11000000.10101000.00001010.00001111
    ```
    
- `255.255.255.0` (subnet mask in binary):
    
    ```
    11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
    ```
    
- The **first 24 bits** (network portion) define the subnet:
    
    ```
    192.168.10.0/24
    ```
    

**Key Concept:**

- **Same network prefix** ‚Üí Devices communicate directly.
- **Different network prefix** ‚Üí Traffic goes through a router.

### **6. Key Takeaways**

‚úÖ **IPv4 is a 32-bit address divided into four octets** (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).  
‚úÖ **Find your IP address using** `ipconfig` (Windows), `ifconfig` (Linux), `show ip interface brief` (Cisco).  
‚úÖ **Static IPs are assigned to critical devices, DHCP assigns IPs dynamically to users.**  
‚úÖ **Subnets divide networks, requiring routers to communicate between them.**  
‚úÖ **Understanding binary helps define network boundaries and subnetting rules.**

This knowledge is **fundamental for networking, subnetting, and troubleshooting**. üöÄ
