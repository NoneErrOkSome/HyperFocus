### **Detailed Summary of Subnet Masks and IP Addressing**

---

### **1. What is a Subnet Mask?**

- A **subnet mask** is a **32-bit number** that defines which part of an IP address represents the **network** and which part represents the **host**.
    
- Every device in a network has:
    
    1. **An IP address** (e.g., `192.168.10.15`)
    2. **A subnet mask** (e.g., `255.255.255.0`)
    3. **A default gateway** (e.g., `192.168.10.1`)
- **The subnet mask determines whether a destination is within the same network or must be routed via a router**.
    

---

### **2. How Subnet Masks Work**

- A **subnet mask is also 32 bits long**, like an IP address, and can be written in:
    
    - **Dotted decimal format** (e.g., `255.255.255.0`)
    - **Slash notation (CIDR)** (e.g., `/24`)
- **Each IP address consists of:**
    
    - **Network portion** (defines the subnet)
    - **Host portion** (identifies devices within the subnet)
- **Example:**
    
    - **IP Address:** `192.168.10.15`
    - **Subnet Mask:** `255.255.255.0`
    - **Binary Representation:**
        
        ```
        IP Address:    11000000.10101000.00001010.00001111
        Subnet Mask:   11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
        ```
        
    - The **first 24 bits (192.168.10)** define the **network portion**.
    - The **remaining bits (.15)** define the **host portion**.

### **3. How Devices Determine if a Destination is Local or Remote**

1. **Same Subnet:**
    
    - If **both source and destination IPs share the same network portion**, the traffic is sent **directly** via a switch.
    - Example:
        - **Source:** `192.168.10.15`
        - **Destination:** `192.168.10.20`
        - ‚úÖ Both share `192.168.10`, so they communicate directly.
2. **Different Subnet:**
    
    - If the **network portion differs**, the traffic must be sent to the **default gateway (router)**.
    - Example:
        - **Source:** `192.168.10.15`
        - **Destination:** `192.168.11.20`
        - ‚ùå Different subnets, so traffic goes **through a router**.

### **4. Structure of a Subnet Mask**

- A **subnet mask always starts with a block of contiguous 1s followed by a block of 0s**.
- **Valid example:** `11111111.11110000.00000000.00000000` (`/12`)
- **Invalid example:** `11101101.00001000.00000000.00000000` ‚ùå (mix of 1s and 0s)
- **The 1s define the network portion, and the 0s define the host portion**.

---

### **5. Special IP Addresses in a Subnet**

- **The first and last addresses in a subnet cannot be assigned to hosts**.

#### **1. Network Address (All 0s in Host Portion)**

- Identifies the **subnet itself**.
- **Example:** `192.168.10.0`
    - Binary:
        
        ```
        11000000.10101000.00001010.00000000
        ```
        
    - **Cannot be assigned to a device**.

#### **2. Broadcast Address (All 1s in Host Portion)**

- Sends data to **all hosts in a subnet**.
- **Example:** `192.168.10.255`
    - Binary:
        
        ```
        11000000.10101000.00001010.11111111
        ```
        
    - **Cannot be assigned to a device**.

### **6. Assignable IP Range in a Subnet**

- After **excluding** the **network address** and **broadcast address**, the usable **host range** is:
    
    - **First assignable address:** `192.168.10.1`
    - **Last assignable address:** `192.168.10.254`
    - ‚úÖ **Usable range:** `192.168.10.1 ‚Äì 192.168.10.254`
- **Example:**
    
    - **Subnet:** `192.168.10.0/24`
    - **Usable host range:** `192.168.10.1 ‚Äì 192.168.10.254`
    - **Total hosts:** `254`

---

### **7. Host Uniqueness and Addressing Rules**

- **Each host within a subnet must have a unique IP address**.
    
- **Duplicate IP addresses cause conflicts**, making devices unreachable.
    
- **Example of duplicate IP issue:**
    
    - **Host A:** `10.10.10.10`
    - **Host B:** `10.10.10.10` ‚ùå (Conflict)
- **A device can have the same last octet if it is in a different subnet:**
    
    - ‚úÖ `10.10.10.10` (Subnet A)
    - ‚úÖ `10.10.20.10` (Subnet B)

### **8. Key Takeaways**

‚úÖ **A subnet mask defines the network and host portions of an IP address.**  
‚úÖ **Devices on the same subnet communicate directly; different subnets require a router.**  
‚úÖ **The network address (all 0s in host portion) and broadcast address (all 1s in host portion) cannot be assigned to devices.**  
‚úÖ **Subnet masks always have a continuous block of 1s followed by 0s.**  
‚úÖ **Understanding subnet masks is critical for network design, security, and routing.**

Mastering **subnet masks** is essential for **IP addressing, subnetting, and network troubleshooting**! üöÄ
