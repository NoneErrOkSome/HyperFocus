### **Why is the Subnet Mask `255.255.255.254`?**

The subnet mask **`255.255.255.254`** is used for **/31 subnetting**, which is **specialized for point-to-point links**. Let‚Äôs break it down.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the Binary Representation**

Subnet masks define how many bits are used for the **network portion** and how many for the **host portion**.

#### **`255.255.255.254` in Binary:**

```
11111111.11111111.11111111.11111110
```

- The **first 31 bits** (all `1`s) are for the **network portion**.
- The **last bit** (`0`) is for the **host portion**.

Since there is **only 1 bit left** for hosts, the possible values are:

- `0`
- `1`

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Why is the Last Octet 254?**

A subnet mask is derived by **adding up the decimal values of the network bits**.

Each octet consists of **8 bits**, with decimal values assigned as follows:

|Bit Position|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Decimal Value|128|64|32|16|8|4|2|1|

For `255.255.255.254`:

- **The first three octets are `255`** (all bits `1`):
    - `11111111` = **255**
    - `11111111` = **255**
    - `11111111` = **255**
- **The last octet is `254`**, which is:
    - `11111110` = **128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 254**

Thus, the mask **only leaves 1 bit (the last `0`) for host addressing**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Why Use /31 Instead of /30?**

In traditional subnetting, the **first address is reserved for the network** and the **last address is reserved for broadcast**, meaning a **/30** subnet (which has 4 addresses) provides only **2 usable hosts**.

However, for **point-to-point links**, we don‚Äôt need a **network** or **broadcast address**. Cisco introduced **/31 subnets** so both IPs in the subnet can be used.

- **`/30` (Subnet: `255.255.255.252`)**
    - 4 total IPs ‚Üí **2 usable hosts** (`network + broadcast reserved`).
- **`/31` (Subnet: `255.255.255.254`)**
    - 2 total IPs ‚Üí **2 usable hosts** (`no network/broadcast needed`).

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Key Takeaways**

‚úî **`255.255.255.254` leaves only 1 bit for hosts (`0` or `1`).**  
‚úî **`/31` subnets (2 IPs) are optimized for point-to-point links.**  
‚úî **This subnetting method avoids wasting addresses on network & broadcast.**  
‚úî **Cisco routers support `/31` for efficient routing.**
