### **Why Classful Addressing Was Obsoleted & CIDR Was Introduced**

Classful addressing was **inefficient, inflexible, and wasteful**, leading to **IPv4 exhaustion** and **routing table overload**. CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) solved these problems by **removing fixed class boundaries and allowing subnetting at any bit length**.

---

## **1. Problems with Classful Addressing** 🚨

### **🔴 Problem 1: Wasting IPs (Rigid Address Allocation)**

- **Class A (`/8`) → 16 million IPs per network**
- **Class B (`/16`) → 65,534 IPs per network**
- **Class C (`/24`) → 254 IPs per network**

🔹 **Example:**  
A company needing **500 IPs** was forced to take an entire **Class B (/16)** with **65,534** addresses. **Over 64,000 IPs were wasted!**

🔹 **Real-world Impact:**

- Universities, corporations, and governments got **huge Class A and B blocks**, leaving **small businesses and ISPs with no room to grow**.
- By the 1990s, **IPv4 exhaustion became a serious threat**.

---

### **🔴 Problem 2: No Subnetting Flexibility**

- Each class had **fixed boundaries** (`/8`, `/16`, `/24`), so **networks couldn't be right-sized**.
- If a company needed **1000 hosts**, they had no option between:
    - **Class C (254 hosts → too small)**
    - **Class B (65,534 hosts → too large and wasteful)**

🔹 **Example of Inflexible Allocation:**

|Need|Class C (/24)|Class B (/16)|Problem|
|---|---|---|---|
|**500 Hosts**|❌ Too small (only 254 IPs)|✅ Fits but wastes 65,000 IPs|Huge waste|
|**2,000 Hosts**|❌ Too small (need 8 x /24 blocks)|✅ Fits but wastes 63,000+ IPs|Waste or fragmentation|
|**50,000 Hosts**|❌ Impossible with Class C|✅ Fits but still wastes 15,000+ IPs|Waste|

**No way to get exactly what you need!** 😡

---

### **🔴 Problem 3: Huge Routing Tables (Internet Scalability Issue)**

- Every **Class A, B, or C network** had to be **individually routed** on the internet.
- This **flooded routers** with **millions of unnecessary routes**.
- The **early 1990s internet** couldn't handle the growth.

🔹 **Example:**

- With classful addressing, routing tables looked like this:
    
    ```
    192.168.1.0/24 → ISP A
    192.168.2.0/24 → ISP A
    192.168.3.0/24 → ISP A
    192.168.4.0/24 → ISP A
    ```
    
- **Every subnet had to be routed separately**.
- **This massively increased router memory & CPU usage**.

---

## **2. CIDR: The Solution ✅**

### **🟢 CIDR Fixes IP Wastage (Efficient Subnetting)**

- Instead of **Class A, B, or C**, CIDR lets you use **any prefix length (`/8 – /32`)**.
- **Companies get exactly what they need.**

🔹 **Example:**  
A company needing **500 IPs** no longer takes a wasteful `/16`. Instead, they receive a **/23** with 510 usable IPs.

|**CIDR Prefix**|**Subnet Mask**|**Usable Hosts**|**Efficient for:**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**/23**|`255.255.254.0`|510|Company with ~500 devices|
|**/26**|`255.255.255.192`|62|Small business|
|**/30**|`255.255.255.252`|2|Point-to-point links|

✅ **No more forced allocation into too big/small networks!**

---

### **🟢 CIDR Fixes Routing Table Bloat (Route Summarization)**

CIDR allows **IP aggregation**, meaning **multiple networks can be summarized into a single route**.

🔹 **Example: Summarizing Routes with CIDR** Instead of **4 separate Class C routes**:

```
192.168.0.0/24 → ISP A
192.168.1.0/24 → ISP A
192.168.2.0/24 → ISP A
192.168.3.0/24 → ISP A
```

CIDR **summarizes** them into **one** route:

```
192.168.0.0/22 → ISP A
```

✅ **Routers only need to store ONE route instead of FOUR!**  
✅ **Reduces routing table size, improves speed, and saves memory!**

---

## **3. CIDR Demonstration: Before & After**

Let's visualize how CIDR replaces the **rigid classful system** with **efficient IP allocation**.

---

### **🔴 BEFORE CIDR (Classful Addressing)**

- **Fixed class boundaries** (`/8`, `/16`, `/24`)
- **Lots of wasted IPs**
- **Large, inefficient routing tables**

|Class|Subnet Mask|IP Range|Usable Hosts|
|---|---|---|---|
|**A**|`255.0.0.0`|`10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255`|16.7M|
|**B**|`255.255.0.0`|`172.16.0.0 – 172.16.255.255`|65K|
|**C**|`255.255.255.0`|`192.168.1.0 – 192.168.1.255`|254|

❌ **Problem:** A company needing 500 hosts must take an entire **Class B (/16)**. → WASTES 65,000+ IPs.

---

### **🟢 AFTER CIDR (Efficient Subnetting)**

- **No more fixed classes**
- **Networks are right-sized** (`/22`, `/23`, `/27`, etc.)
- **Smaller routing tables**

|CIDR|Subnet Mask|IP Range|Usable Hosts|
|---|---|---|---|
|**/22**|`255.255.252.0`|`192.168.0.0 – 192.168.3.255`|1,022|
|**/23**|`255.255.254.0`|`192.168.0.0 – 192.168.1.255`|510|
|**/27**|`255.255.255.224`|`192.168.0.0 – 192.168.0.31`|30|

✅ **Problem solved!** A company needing **500 IPs** now gets a **/23 (510 IPs) instead of a wasteful /16**.

---

## **4. Conclusion: Why CIDR Replaced Classful Addressing**

|**Issue**|**Classful Addressing** ❌|**CIDR** ✅|
|---|---|---|
|**IP Waste**|Forced into /8, /16, /24 blocks|Custom-sized networks (/22, /25, /30)|
|**Subnet Flexibility**|No control over host size|Full control over prefix length|
|**Routing Efficiency**|Millions of individual routes|Route summarization (aggregation)|
|**IPv4 Exhaustion**|Huge waste of addresses|Efficient use of IPv4|

🚀 **CIDR allowed IPv4 to last longer and enabled scalable internet growth.**
