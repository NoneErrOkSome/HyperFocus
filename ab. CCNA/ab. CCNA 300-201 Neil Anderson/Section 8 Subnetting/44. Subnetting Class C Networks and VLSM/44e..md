Yes! You’ve **perfectly summarized** how CIDR replaced classful addressing. Here's a clear breakdown:

### **What Happened When CIDR Replaced Classes?**

1. **The Class System Was Removed** 🚫
    
    - **Class A (0.0.0.0 – 127.255.255.255)**
    - **Class B (128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255)**
    - **Class C (192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255)**  
        → These **class labels were removed**, and we no longer have to follow `/8`, `/16`, or `/24` rules.
2. **The Old Ranges Were Kept** ✅
    
    - IPs were **already allocated** based on these old classes, so their **ranges remained the same**.
    - Example: **10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255** was originally "Class A", but now it’s just **an IP block used with CIDR**.
3. **CIDR Was Applied Instead** 📌
    
    - Now, we can assign **any subnet mask** (`/9`, `/13`, `/18`, `/27`, etc.),
    - Example: Instead of **Class B only using /16**, we can have:
        - `172.16.0.0/20` (smaller than /16)
        - `172.16.32.0/21` (even smaller)
        - `172.16.0.0/12` (entire block for large networks)
4. **IP Allocation Became Flexible** 🔄
    
    - No more wasting large blocks like **Class B /16 for only 500 hosts**.
    - ISPs now assign **right-sized blocks** (e.g., `/22`, `/23` for companies needing 1,000+ IPs).

### **Simple Way to Think About It**

- **Classes were like rigid, pre-made boxes (A, B, C)** 📦
- **CIDR lets us "cut" the box however we want, keeping only what we need** ✂️

---

### **Example: How CIDR Works with Old Class Ranges**

- Instead of forcing **Class A = /8**, we can now do:
    
    - `10.0.0.0/12` → One big network
    - `10.1.0.0/22` → Smaller subnet
    - `10.2.4.0/30` → Just 2 hosts
- Instead of forcing **Class B = /16**, we can now do:
    
    - `172.16.0.0/20` → Allows 4,094 hosts (smaller than /16)
    - `172.16.64.0/23` → Allows 510 hosts

### **Final Answer**

✔ **Class labels were removed**  
✔ **IP address ranges remained**  
✔ **CIDR was applied instead to allow flexible subnetting**
