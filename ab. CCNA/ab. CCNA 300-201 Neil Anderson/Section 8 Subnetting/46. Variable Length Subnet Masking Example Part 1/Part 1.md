### **Part 1: Introduction to VLSM & Network Requirements**

---

## **1. What Is Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)?**

Before **Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)** was introduced, **subnetting required all subnets to be the same size**. This was because early routing protocols, such as **RIPv1**, did not support the use of different subnet sizes within the same network.

ðŸ”¹ **Example of Fixed Subnetting (Without VLSM):**

- If one department needed **28 hosts**, all subnets had to be **/27** (30 hosts), even if other subnets only needed **10 hosts**.
- **Problem:** Wasted IP addresses in subnets that didn't need as many hosts.
- **Solution:** VLSM allows each subnet to have different sizes, based on actual host requirements.

## **2. Why Do We Use VLSM?**

ðŸ”¹ **IP Address Efficiency:** VLSM ensures that each subnet **only uses the necessary number of IPs**, reducing wasted addresses.  
ðŸ”¹ **More Subnets Within a Network:** By using different subnet sizes, an organization can fit **more subnets into a given IP block**.  
ðŸ”¹ **Improved Network Organization:** Different departments or locations can have **different subnet sizes** while still being part of the same main network.  
ðŸ”¹ **Better Security & Traffic Management:** Departments can be separated into subnets, making **firewall rules and routing policies more effective**.

## **3. Network Topology Overview**

In this example, we are given a **Class C network `200.15.10.0/24`**, and we must **subnet it using VLSM** to fit our specific network requirements.

### **Network Locations & Host Requirements:**

|**Location**|**Department**|**Host Count**|
|---|---|---|
|**New York (HQ)**|Engineering|28 hosts|
||Sales|14 hosts|
|**Boston (Branch)**|Engineering|28 hosts|
||Sales|7 hosts|
|**Point-to-Point**|NY â†” Boston Router Link|2 hosts|

## **4. Why Different Locations Need Different Subnet Sizes?**

Each department and link has **different host requirements**, so assigning the same subnet size to all locations would **waste many IP addresses**. Instead, **VLSM allows us to assign different subnet sizes based on actual needs**.

ðŸ”¹ **Engineering Departments (28 hosts each):**

- A **/28 (14 hosts)** would be **too small**.
- A **/27 (30 hosts)** is the smallest subnet that fits **28 hosts**.

ðŸ”¹ **Sales Departments (14 and 7 hosts):**

- A **/28 (14 hosts)** is **just right** for New York Sales.
- A **/29 (6 hosts)** is too small for Boston Sales, so we use **/28 (14 hosts)** instead.

ðŸ”¹ **Point-to-Point Link (2 hosts):**

- A **/30 (2 hosts)** is **perfect** because it provides just enough IPs.

## **5. Important Considerations for Subnet Planning**

When designing subnets using VLSM, there are **several important factors to consider**:

### **A. How Many Different Locations Need Subnets?**

- Each department, office, and network segment needs its **own subnet**.
- Example: Even though **New York and Boston both have Engineering**, they are **separate networks**, so they need **separate subnets**.

### **B. How Many Hosts Will Be in Each Subnet?**

- Each department or link **has a different number of hosts**, so we must **match subnet sizes accordingly**.
- **Subnet mask choice affects how many devices can be connected.**
- Example: If we allocate a **/27 subnet** (30 hosts) for a department that only needs **10 hosts**, we are **wasting 20 IPs**.

### **C. What Are the IP Addressing Requirements for Different Departments?**

- Different subnets may require **different security and access policies**.
- Example: **Accounting & HR should not share a subnet with Engineering** because of **confidential financial data**.
- **By subnetting different departments separately**, we can **control security policies** and **prevent unnecessary internal traffic**.

### **D. Choosing the Right Subnet Size (Balance Between Growth & Efficiency)**

- **Too large = wasted IPs**
- **Too small = network redesign required later**
- **Best practice:** Leave **some room for future growth** but do not **oversize unnecessarily**.

ðŸ”¹ **Real-World vs. Exam Considerations:**  
âœ” In **real-world networking**, **leave room for growth** when subnetting.  
âœ” In **CCNA exams**, **use the smallest subnet possible** to **maximize address efficiency** (if the question says to).

## **6. Final Thoughts on VLSM Design**

Now that we understand the **importance of subnetting based on host requirements**, we can start **allocating subnets sequentially**, from **largest to smallest**, ensuring **optimal use of available IPs**.

- **Allocating subnets based on host requirements**
- **Using the correct subnet mask for each department**
- **Sequentially assigning network addresses**
