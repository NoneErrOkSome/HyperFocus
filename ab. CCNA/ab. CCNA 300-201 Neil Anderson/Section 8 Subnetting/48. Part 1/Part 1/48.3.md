Absolutely â€” letâ€™s slow down and go **step by step**, explaining **everything** clearly and simply. No skipping. Youâ€™re doing great for asking for clarity. Letâ€™s break down:

# ðŸ§  **How Many `/29` Subnets Can You Get From a `/16` Block?**

---

### âœ… STEP 1: Understand What `/16` Means

**An IP address has 32 bits.**

- When we say `/16`, it means:
    - The **first 16 bits** are fixed (reserved for the network)
    - The **remaining 16 bits** are free â€” for either subnetting or host usage

So a `/16` network gives:

216=65,536Â totalÂ IPÂ addresses2^{16} = 65,536 \text{ total IP addresses}

This means:

> From `135.15.0.0` to `135.15.255.255` â€” that's your full IP space

---

### âœ… STEP 2: Understand What `/29` Means

- `/29` means the **first 29 bits are fixed**
- So:
    - **32 total bits** âˆ’ 29 bits = **3 bits for hosts**

This gives:

- **Total addresses per `/29`**: 23=8Â IPÂ addressesÂ perÂ /29Â subnet2^3 = 8 \text{ IP addresses per /29 subnet}

---

### âœ… STEP 3: Find Out How Many `/29` Subnets Fit Inside `/16`

We now want to know:

> How many blocks of 8 IP addresses fit inside 65,536?

So:

65,536Â IPsÂ inÂ /168Â IPsÂ perÂ /29=8,192\frac{65,536 \text{ IPs in /16}}{8 \text{ IPs per /29}} = 8,192

That means:

> You can divide a `/16` block into **8,192 separate `/29` subnets**

---

### âœ… STEP 4: What Does Each `/29` Subnet Give You?

Each `/29` subnet contains:

- 8 total IP addresses
- 1 is the **network address**
- 1 is the **broadcast address**
- Remaining **6 IPs are usable** for devices

So if you use one `/29`, you get:

- Usable IPs: `6`
- Example:  
    `135.15.0.0/29` has usable IPs `135.15.0.1 â€“ 135.15.0.6`

If you use **2** `/29` blocks, you get:

2Ã—6=12Â usableÂ IPs2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ usable IPs}

If you use **100** `/29` blocks:

100Ã—6=600Â usableÂ IPs100 \times 6 = 600 \text{ usable IPs}

But you're still only using:

100Ã—8=800Â totalÂ IPsÂ outÂ ofÂ theÂ 65,536100 \times 8 = 800 \text{ total IPs out of the 65,536}

---

### âœ… Recap Summary (Plain English)

- ISP gives you a big `/16` (65,536 IPs total)
- You divide it into smaller `/29` blocks (8 IPs each)
- Each `/29` can be used for a small group of devices (up to 6)
- You can create up to **8,192** of these `/29` blocks

---

Would you like to see how the first 5 `/29` blocks look like with their:

- Network address
- Broadcast address
- Usable IP range?
