Awesome! Letâ€™s walk through the **first 5 `/29` subnets** inside a `/16` block step-by-step. Weâ€™ll use this block:

> **Given by ISP**: `135.15.0.0/16`

We'll now **subnet it** into `/29` blocks.

---

## ðŸ”¢ **Each `/29` Block Has:**

- **8 IP addresses total**
- 1 **network address** (first IP)
- 1 **broadcast address** (last IP)
- 6 **usable IPs** in between

---

## âœ… First 5 `/29` Subnets from `135.15.0.0/16`

Letâ€™s calculate each manually, line by line.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. `135.15.0.0/29`

- Network address: `135.15.0.0`
- Usable IPs: `135.15.0.1` â†’ `135.15.0.6`
- Broadcast address: `135.15.0.7`

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. `135.15.0.8/29`

- (Next block = previous network + 8)
- Network address: `135.15.0.8`
- Usable IPs: `135.15.0.9` â†’ `135.15.0.14`
- Broadcast address: `135.15.0.15`

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. `135.15.0.16/29`

- Network address: `135.15.0.16`
- Usable IPs: `135.15.0.17` â†’ `135.15.0.22`
- Broadcast address: `135.15.0.23`

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. `135.15.0.24/29`

- Network address: `135.15.0.24`
- Usable IPs: `135.15.0.25` â†’ `135.15.0.30`
- Broadcast address: `135.15.0.31`

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. `135.15.0.32/29`

- Network address: `135.15.0.32`
- Usable IPs: `135.15.0.33` â†’ `135.15.0.38`
- Broadcast address: `135.15.0.39`

---

## ðŸ§  How We're Doing This (Explanation)

- `/29` = **8 IPs per block**
- You just keep **adding 8** to the previous network address to get the next one

|Block #|Network Address|Add +8 â†’ Next Block|
|---|---|---|
|1|`135.15.0.0`|`135.15.0.8`|
|2|`135.15.0.8`|`135.15.0.16`|
|3|`135.15.0.16`|`135.15.0.24`|
|4|`135.15.0.24`|`135.15.0.32`|
|5|`135.15.0.32`|`135.15.0.40`|

...and it continues up to `135.15.255.248/29` in the full `/16`.

Would you like me to continue with the **next 5**, or show how to **find which block an IP belongs to** using the **magic number method**?
