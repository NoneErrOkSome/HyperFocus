Absolutely! Let's break down the **Magic Number Method** in the clearest, most beginner-friendly way — with **no skipped steps**, **plain English**, and a **working example** at the end.

# 🪄 **What Is the Magic Number Method?**

The **Magic Number Method** is a shortcut to quickly calculate:

1. **Network Address**
2. **Broadcast Address**
3. **Usable Host Range**

> It's especially useful when you're given an **IP address and subnet mask** and you want to know which block (subnet) it belongs to.

---

## ✅ When to Use the Magic Number Method

Use it when you're given:

- A subnet **in CIDR (`/xx`) or dotted decimal mask**
- An IP like: `192.168.10.138/27`
- And you want to know what subnet it belongs to, and what its range is.

---

## ✅ STEP-BY-STEP: Magic Number Method

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Convert CIDR to Subnet Mask (if needed)

Example:

- CIDR: `/27`
- Subnet mask: `255.255.255.224`

Why? Because:

- 8+8+8 = 24 (first 3 octets = 255)
- Remaining: 3 bits used → `128 + 64 + 32 = 224`

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Get the "Magic Number"

> Take the **last non-255 octet** in the subnet mask  
> Subtract it from 256:

Example:

- Subnet mask: `255.255.255.224`
- Last octet = `224`
- So: 256−224=32256 - 224 = 32

✅ **Magic Number = 32**

This tells you:

> "Subnets go up in blocks of 32"

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Find Which Block the IP Belongs To

Now, look at the IP address.

Let’s say:

- IP = `192.168.10.138`

Focus on the **last octet** (because subnetting is on the 4th octet here):

- Last octet = `138`

Find the **highest multiple of 32** that is **less than or equal to 138**

List out:

- 0, 32, 64, 96, 128, **160** ❌ too far

→ So `128` is the correct block start.

✅ **Network Address** = `192.168.10.128`

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Calculate the Broadcast Address

Just add the magic number and subtract 1:

128+32=160,160−1=159128 + 32 = 160,\quad 160 - 1 = 159

✅ **Broadcast Address** = `192.168.10.159`

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Usable Host Range

Everything between the network and broadcast:

- First usable IP:
    
    ```
    192.168.10.129
    ```
    
- Last usable IP:
    
    ```
    192.168.10.158
    ```
    

---

## ✅ Final Result (Magic Number Method)

Given:

> `192.168.10.138/27`

|Field|Value|
|---|---|
|Subnet Mask|`255.255.255.224`|
|Magic Number|`32`|
|Network Address|`192.168.10.128`|
|Broadcast Address|`192.168.10.159`|
|Usable IP Range|`192.168.10.129 – 158`|

---

## 💡 Why It's Called "Magic Number"

Because the number you get from:

> `256 - subnet mask octet`

…**magically tells you**:

- The size of each subnet
- The jump to the next block
- The subnet range for any IP address

---

## 🔁 Recap

|Step|What You Do|
|---|---|
|1|Convert CIDR to subnet mask (if needed)|
|2|Find magic number = 256 − mask octet|
|3|Find nearest lower multiple of that number|
|4|That’s your network address|
|5|Add number − 1 = broadcast address|
|6|IPs in between = usable host range|
