You're very welcome â€” and I completely understand your point. Let's forget about the math for a moment. Here's a **clear, plain-English breakdown** of what the instructor was _really trying to teach_ in this lecture:

---

## âœ… **Big Picture: What This Lesson Is About**

The instructor is showing you how **subnetting works exactly the same**, no matter if youâ€™re working with:

- A **Class A network** (like `60.0.0.0`)
- A **Class B network** (like `135.15.0.0`)
- Or a **Class C network** (like `192.168.1.0`)

The difference isnâ€™t **how subnetting works**, itâ€™s **how many bits** you have available to create subnets or hosts, depending on the class.

---

## ðŸ§  **Major Concepts You Should Take Away**

### 1. **Subnetting is universal**

> The method doesnâ€™t change just because youâ€™re working with Class A, B, or C.

You still:

- Choose how many bits to use for subnets (network)
- Leave some bits for host addresses

---

### 2. **Same subnet size = same number of hosts, no matter the class**

> For example, if you use a `/29` subnet, you will **always** get 6 usable hosts, whether you're in a Class A, B, or C network.

This is because subnetting is based on the **total 32 bits** of an IP address â€” not the class.

---

### 3. **Subnetting larger networks gives you more subnets**

> When you start with a bigger range like `/8` (Class A) or `/16` (Class B), you can create **a lot more subnets** than you can from `/24` (Class C).

Thatâ€™s why ISPs or enterprises subnet Class A and B networks â€” to split large blocks into smaller, manageable chunks.

---

### 4. **You can calculate subnets multiple ways**

> The instructor shows two methods:

- **Binary method** (more detailed)
- **Magic number method** (faster and more mental)

Use whichever one makes more sense to you. They give the same result.

---

### 5. **Subnetting often happens on the 4th octet**

> In real-world and exam scenarios, youâ€™re usually subnetting **in the last octet** (the fourth group of numbers, like `10.0.0.__64__`). Thatâ€™s where the address changes most often.

---

### 6. **You only need to find 3 things**

Every time you subnet, the goal is to figure out:

- **The network address** (starting IP of the subnet)
- **The broadcast address** (ending IP of the subnet)
- **The usable host range** (everything in between)

---

### Final Message:

> **Subnetting is not class-dependent.**  
> Once you understand how many bits are for subnetting vs. hosts, you can calculate subnet ranges for any type of network.

Would you like me to give you a simple real-world analogy next to make subnetting even easier to understand?
