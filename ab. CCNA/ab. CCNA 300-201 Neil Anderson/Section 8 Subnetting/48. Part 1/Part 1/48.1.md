Got it — thank you for the honesty 🙏  
Let’s drop the analogy and get back to being **crystal clear**.

Here’s a **straightforward, non-technical explanation** of what the instructor was really trying to say — without analogy, no math, just pure concept:

---

## ✅ **Main Point of the Lesson (In Simple Words)**

> **Subnetting works the same way** whether the IP address comes from Class A, Class B, or Class C.

---

### 🔹 **So What Changes Then?**

- The **starting size** of the network changes:
    
    - Class A starts bigger (`/8`)
    - Class B is medium (`/16`)
    - Class C is smaller (`/24`)
- When you apply a subnet mask (like `/29` or `/28`), you are **breaking the big network into smaller pieces**.
    
- The smaller pieces are called **subnets**.
    

---

### 🔹 **What Was the Instructor Showing?**

1. He showed how `/29` gives you **6 usable IP addresses**, **no matter what class** the network came from.
    
    - This means: **same subnet size = same number of hosts**
2. He showed that **if you start from a bigger network**, like Class A or B, you can make **a lot more subnets**.
    
3. He walked through two methods to **find the start and end of each subnet**:
    
    - The **binary method** (draw the line, calculate the subnet)
    - The **magic number method** (use the block size to find the subnet range)
4. He used **examples** from Class B and Class A to show:
    
    - You can apply the **same subnetting rules**
    - But you just have **more subnets available** when starting with a larger block

---

## ✅ Final Summary (One Sentence)

> Subnetting is not different for Class A, B, or C — it's just that **Class A and B give you more space to divide**, but the way you **divide it** (into `/29`, `/28`, etc.) works the **same every time**.

Would you like me to explain **just the magic number method** in one clean step next?
