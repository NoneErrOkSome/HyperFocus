### **How Many Parts Are Needed to Cover All Details?**

To **summarize all details clearly and concisely**, I will break the explanation into **four parts**:

---

### **Part 1: Subnetting New York Sales Department**

- Determine the **optimal subnet mask** for **14 hosts**.
- Calculate the **network address, broadcast address, and usable host range**.
- Explain why **/28** is chosen over **/29**.

---

### **Part 2: Subnetting Boston Sales Department**

- Repeat the same process for **Boston Sales** (7 hosts).
- Explain why **/28 is used instead of /29**.
- Assign the **network, broadcast, and host addresses** sequentially.

---

### **Part 3: Subnetting the Point-to-Point Link**

- Identify the **correct subnet mask** for **2 hosts**.
- Explain why **/30 is preferred over /31** for the exam.
- Assign the **network, broadcast, and host addresses** for router interfaces.

---

### **Part 4: Completing the Network Diagram with IP Assignments**

- Label each subnet in the **network diagram** with the **correct CIDR notation**.
- Assign **router interface IPs** using the **first available address**.
- Ensure **no subnet overlaps** and all **departments are properly structured**.
