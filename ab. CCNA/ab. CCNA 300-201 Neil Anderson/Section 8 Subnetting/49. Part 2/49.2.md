# 🧠 PART 2: Subnetting a Class A Network `60.0.0.0/8` into `/19`

---

## ✅ STEP 1: What are we given?

You are given this **Class A block**: 60.0.0.0/8

You are asked to **subnet it into `/19`** blocks.

---

## ✅ STEP 2: Understand What `/19` Means

- IP addresses are made of **32 bits** total  
- `/19` means the **first 19 bits are fixed** (used for network/subnet)  
- That leaves:
  $$
  32 - 19 = 13 \text{ bits left}
  $$

These **13 bits are for hosts**.

---

## ✅ STEP 3: How Many Hosts in Each `/19` Subnet?

Formula to calculate usable hosts:
$$
2^{\text{host bits}} - 2
$$

We have 13 host bits:
$$
2^{13} = 8192
$$

Subtract 2 for:
- 1 reserved for network address  
- 1 reserved for broadcast address

So:
$$
8192 - 2 = \boxed{8190 \text{ usable hosts}}
$$

✅ **Each `/19` subnet can hold 8190 devices**

---

## ✅ STEP 4: How Many Subnets Did We Create?

You started with:
- A **Class A block** = `/8`  
- You’re subnetting it into `/19`

So the number of **new subnet bits** used is:
$$
19 - 8 = 11 \text{ bits used for subnetting}
$$

Now calculate how many subnets you created:
$$
2^{11} = \boxed{2048 \text{ subnets}}
$$

✅ So from your original `/8`, you created **2048 separate `/19` subnets**

---

## ✅ STEP 5: Practice Problem

You’re given an IP address inside one of those subnets:

60.15.10.75/19


You're asked:
- What is the **network address**?
- What is the **broadcast address**?
- What is the **usable host IP range**?

---

## ✅ STEP 6: Understand Where Subnetting Happens

You’re subnetting with `/19`. That means:

- Full 8 bits (1st octet) → already part of the original Class A  
- Full 8 bits (2nd octet) → fixed  
- **3 bits of the 3rd octet** are used for subnetting  
- That means: **subnetting is happening in the 3rd octet**

---

## ✅ STEP 7: Use the Magic Number Method

We’re working with:
- Subnet mask: `/19`  
- Convert to dotted decimal: `/19` = `255.255.224.0`

Take the last **non-255 octet**, which is `224`

Then:
$$
256 - 224 = 32
$$

✅ That means **the subnets increment by 32** in the 3rd octet  
→ We're going up in **blocks of 32 on the 3rd octet**

---

## ✅ STEP 8: Find the Block That Contains `60.15.10.75`

Look at the **3rd octet** → it's `10`

List the subnet blocks going up by 32:

- `0–31` ✅ ← This is where `.10` belongs  
- `32–63`  
- `64–95`  
- ...

So:

- **Network Address**: `60.15.0.0`  
- **Next Network Block**: `60.15.32.0`  
- **Broadcast Address**: 1 before that:

60.15.31.255


✅ Confirmed by instructor in the transcript

---

## ✅ STEP 9: Find the Usable Host Range

Usable host IPs are **everything between the network and broadcast**:

- First usable: `60.15.0.1`  
- Last usable: `60.15.31.254`

✅ So the **usable range** is: 60.15.0.1 – 60.15.31.254



---

## ✅ Final Answer Recap

| Field               | Value                         |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Network Address      | `60.15.0.0`                   |
| Broadcast Address    | `60.15.31.255`                |
| Usable Host Range    | `60.15.0.1 – 60.15.31.254`    |
| Hosts per Subnet     | `8190`                        |

## ✅ Bonus: How to Recognize Subnetting on the 3rd Octet

You are subnetting the **3rd octet** when:

- The subnet mask is **between `/16` and `/24`**
- That means you're no longer chopping the 4th octet
- You have to apply subnet logic on the **3rd octet instead**

So instead of counting `.0 – .7`, `.8 – .15`, you count:

- `x.0.0 – x.31.255`  
- `x.32.0 – x.63.255`  
- `x.64.0 – x.95.255`  
  ... and so on.

Would you like to try calculating the **next subnet** after `60.15.0.0/19` to see how it jumps? 😎
