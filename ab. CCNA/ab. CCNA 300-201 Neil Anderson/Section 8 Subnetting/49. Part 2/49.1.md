Perfect ‚Äî you‚Äôve now provided the **second part** of the lesson, and you want to understand:

> **What is the instructor really trying to say in this whole example (part 2)?**

I'll now explain **in plain English**, clearly and completely, what the instructor is teaching you ‚Äî step by step ‚Äî **without skipping anything** or adding confusion.

# üß† **What the Instructor Is Communicating in This Lesson (Part 2)**

---

## ‚úÖ 1. **Subnetting Can Happen on the 3rd Octet ‚Äî Not Just the 4th**

Most examples so far were **subnetting the 4th octet** (like when you subnet a `/24`, `/28`, etc.). But in this lesson:

> He shows how subnetting can happen **on the 3rd octet**, when the subnet mask is somewhere **between `/16` and `/24`**.

üß† That means:

- We're no longer slicing in the last octet.  
- We are dividing in the third octet, which changes the size of each subnet dramatically.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. **Example: Subnetting a Class A `/8` into `/19`**

You're given:

- Network: `60.0.0.0/8` (Class A)  
- You subnet it into: `/19`

### üß© What happens when you do this?

- Subnet mask `/19` means:
  - First 19 bits are fixed for network/subnet  
  - Remaining host bits:
    $$
    32 - 19 = 13
    $$

- Total IPs per subnet:
  $$
  2^{13} = 8192 \text{ total IPs per subnet} \Rightarrow 8190 \text{ usable hosts}
  $$

- New subnet bits:
  $$
  19 - 8 = 11 \text{ subnet bits} \Rightarrow 2^{11} = 2048 \text{ subnets}
  $$

---

## ‚úÖ 3. **How to Find the Subnet Range of a Given IP**

### Example:

> Given IP: `60.15.10.75/19`  
> What‚Äôs the:
> - Network address  
> - Broadcast address  
> - Host range

---

### üîç How to solve:

#### ‚û§ Step 1: Recognize that `/19` = `255.255.224.0`  
- The last octet with value is `224`  
- So the subnet increment is:
  $$
  256 - 224 = 32 \Rightarrow \text{subnet increments of 32 on the 3rd octet}
  $$

---

#### ‚û§ Step 2: Identify valid blocks

Valid `/19` networks inside `60.x.x.x` go up by 32 in the 3rd octet:

- `60.15.0.0`  
- `60.15.32.0`  
- `60.15.64.0`  
- ‚Ä¶

Since `10 < 32`, IP `60.15.10.75` falls in:

> `60.15.0.0` ‚Üí `60.15.31.255`

---

### ‚úÖ Final Answer:

| Field              | Value                    |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Network Address     | `60.15.0.0`              |
| Broadcast Address   | `60.15.31.255`           |
| Usable Host Range   | `60.15.0.1 ‚Äì 60.15.31.254` |
| Hosts per Subnet    | 8190                     |

---

## ‚úÖ 4. **Same Magic Number Method Applies**

The instructor reuses the **magic number method**, but this time **on the 3rd octet**:

> `/19` = 3 subnet bits into 3rd octet  
> Binary: `128 + 64 + 32 = 224`  
> So:
> $$
> 256 - 224 = 32
> $$
‚Üí Subnets go up in **blocks of 32 on the 3rd octet**

---

## ‚úÖ 5. **New Practice Question ‚Äì From Class B Network**

> Subnet `134.65.0.0` into **6 subnets**

### ‚û§ How to solve:

- Class B default = `/16`  
- Need 6 subnets ‚Üí need at least 3 bits, because:
  $$
  2^3 = 8 \geq 6
  $$

- New subnet mask:
  $$
  16 + 3 = 19 \Rightarrow \text{new subnet mask is } /19
  $$

### He adds extra details:
- Dotted decimal: `255.255.224.0`  
- Each `/19` block has:
  $$
  2^{13} - 2 = 8190 \text{ usable hosts}
  $$

- Address blocks go up by 32 in the 3rd octet:
  - `134.65.0.0`  
  - `134.65.32.0`  
  - `134.65.64.0`  
  - ‚Ä¶

## ‚úÖ 6. **Final Summary from the Instructor**

Here‚Äôs what he says is **most important to take away**:

> All subnetting questions boil down to two types:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **"How many subnets or hosts do I need?"**  
‚Üí Find the right subnet mask that gives enough

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **"Given an IP and subnet mask, find the network, broadcast, and host range."**  
‚Üí Use **binary** or **magic number** method to solve

He emphasizes:

- You‚Äôve practiced enough by now.  
- You should feel confident.  
- The **format may vary**, but the **logic is always the same**.

## üü¢ Final Recap: What He‚Äôs Teaching

| Concept                        | Explanation                                                  |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Subnetting on the 3rd octet   | Happens when mask is between `/16` and `/24`                |
| `/19` mask                    | Gives 8190 usable hosts per subnet                          |
| Magic number works here too   | Just apply it to the **3rd octet**, not the 4th             |
| Network/broadcast/host range  | Use same method ‚Äî works in all classes (A, B, C)            |
| Practice from Class B block   | `/19` is used to divide into 6 or more subnets              |
| Exam strategy                 | Master the two question types = ready for any subnetting Q  |
