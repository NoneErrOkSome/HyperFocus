Perfect — let’s pick **Question 1** from the 3rd octet section, which hasn't been covered before:

## 🧠 **Question 1: Subnetting on the 3rd Octet**

> Given the IP address:  
> **172.25.146.90/20**
> 
> Find:  
> ✅ Network Address  
> ✅ Broadcast Address  
> ✅ Valid Host Range

---

## 🔍 **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

### 🔸 Step 1: Identify which octet we're subnetting on

CIDR is `/20`:

- /8 → 1st octet
- /16 → 2nd octet
- ✅ /17 to /24 → we're subnetting on the **3rd octet**

---

### 🔸 Step 2: Understand /20 subnetting

- Default for Class B is `/16`, so we're borrowing **4 bits** from the 3rd octet
- Subnet mask in **dotted decimal**: `255.255.240.0`
- Magic number (subnet increment) = 256−240=16256 - 240 = 16

---

### 🔸 Step 3: Find the subnet block

We're subnetting on the **3rd octet**, and `146` is the 3rd octet in the IP address.

Subnets go up in **increments of 16** in the 3rd octet:

- 172.25.**128**.0
- 172.25.**144**.0
- 172.25.**160**.0 ← too high

So **146** falls between **144** and **160**, meaning:

- **Network address**: `172.25.144.0/20`
- **Next subnet**: `172.25.160.0/20`
- **Broadcast address** = one less than next network: `172.25.159.255`

---

### 🔸 Step 4: Find the host address range

Valid hosts = between network and broadcast:

- Start: `172.25.144.1`
- End: `172.25.159.254`

---

## ✅ **Final Answer:**

|Item|Value|
|---|---|
|Network Address|`172.25.144.0/20`|
|Broadcast Address|`172.25.159.255`|
|Host Range|`172.25.144.1` – `172.25.159.254`|
