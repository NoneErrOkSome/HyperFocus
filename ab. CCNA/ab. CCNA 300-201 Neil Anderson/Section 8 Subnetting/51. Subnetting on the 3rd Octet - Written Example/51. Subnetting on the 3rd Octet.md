Here’s a **step-by-step breakdown** of the **“Subnetting on the 3rd Octet”** example from your file, simplified and showing **every single calculation** 👇

---

### 📌 **Given:**

- **IP Address:** `172.19.216.50`
- **Subnet Mask:** `/23`

---

### 🧠 **Step 1: Figure out which octet we are subnetting on**

We check the prefix length `/23`:

- `/1 to /8` → 1st octet
- `/9 to /16` → 2nd octet
- `/17 to /24` → ✅ 3rd octet
- `/25 to /32` → 4th octet

So this is **subnetting on the 3rd octet**.

We write the IP like:

```
172.19.216.50/23
```

---

### 🔢 **Step 2: Convert the address to binary and count bits**

Subnet mask `/23` → 23 bits for **network**, the rest (32−23 = 9 bits) for **hosts**.

Let’s count the bits across each octet:

|Octet|Bit #|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|1st: 172|1–8|Always part of network|
|2nd: 19|9–16|Always part of network|
|3rd: 216|17–24|Only first **7 bits** are network bits, last 1 bit is host|
|4th: 50|25–32|All host bits (8 bits)|

So, the **23rd bit falls on the 3rd octet** at the `bit value = 2`

➡️ This means block size is **2** (from that bit)

---

### 🧮 **Step 3: Find the block size and subnets**

We're working on the 3rd octet (216), with block size **2**:

So the subnets go:

```
172.19.0.0
172.19.2.0
172.19.4.0
...
172.19.216.0 ✅
172.19.218.0
```

➡️ `172.19.216.50` lies in **172.19.216.0**

- **Network Address = 172.19.216.0**

---

### 📡 **Step 4: Find the broadcast address**

Broadcast = **1 less than next network address**

- Next network: `172.19.218.0`
- One less = `172.19.217.255`

✅ **Broadcast Address = 172.19.217.255**

(We subtract 1 from the next subnet, keeping 4th octet at max: 255)

---

### 👥 **Step 5: Find the valid host range**

Valid hosts = from **(network + 1)** to **(broadcast - 1)**

- Network: `172.19.216.0`
- Broadcast: `172.19.217.255`

So:

```
Valid Host Range = 172.19.216.1 → 172.19.217.254
```

---

### ✅ **Final Answers**

|Category|Address|
|---|---|
|Network Address|`172.19.216.0`|
|Broadcast Address|`172.19.217.255`|
|Valid Host Range|`172.19.216.1 – 172.19.217.254`|
