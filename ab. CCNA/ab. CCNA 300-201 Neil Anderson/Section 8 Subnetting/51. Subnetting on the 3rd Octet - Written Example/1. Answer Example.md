Absolutely — let’s slow it way down and go **step-by-step with exact calculations** so you can see how everything fits together.

## 🧠 Question

> IP Address: **172.25.146.90/20**

We’ll find:

1. **Network Address**
2. **Broadcast Address**
3. **Range of Valid Hosts**

---

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 🔸 Step 1: CIDR Breakdown

- The IP address is: `172.25.146.90`
- CIDR = `/20` means:
    
    - First **20 bits** are the **network part**
    - Remaining **12 bits** are the **host part** (since IP is 32 bits total)
    
$$
32 - 20 = 12 \text{ host bits}
$$

### 🔸 Step 2: Figure Out Which Octet We’re Subnetting On

|Octet #|Bits Used (CIDR)|
|---|---|
|1st|8|
|2nd|8|
|3rd|**4** (from CIDR /20)|
|4th|0|

✅ **We're subnetting on the 3rd octet**, because the subnet mask reaches into that octet.

---

### 🔸 Step 3: Subnet Mask in Binary

CIDR `/20` means first 20 bits are 1s:

```
11111111.11111111.11110000.00000000  
```

Convert that into dotted decimal:

- 1st octet: 8 bits of 1 → `255`
- 2nd octet: 8 bits of 1 → `255`
- 3rd octet: 4 bits of 1 → `240`
- 4th octet: 0 bits of 1 → `0`

So the subnet mask is:  
**255.255.240.0**

---

### 🔸 Step 4: Magic Number (Subnet Block Size)

We’re subnetting **on the 3rd octet**, and the 3rd octet has a subnet mask of `240`.

To find the subnet **increment** (or “block size”):


$$
256 - 240 = \boxed{16}
$$


This means subnets go up by 16s in the 3rd octet:

```
172.25.0.0  
172.25.16.0  
172.25.32.0  
...
172.25.144.0 ✅ ← contains .146.90  
172.25.160.0 ← next subnet
```

---

### 🔸 Step 5: Determine the Subnet Range

We know `.146` is the 3rd octet of our IP.  
So `.146` falls in the **172.25.144.0** subnet.

So now we calculate:

- **Network Address**: `172.25.144.0`
- **Next Network Address**: `172.25.160.0`
- **Broadcast Address** = one before next network: $$
\text{Broadcast Address} = \text{one before next network: } \text{Broadcast} = \texttt{172.25.159.255}
$$


---

### 🔸 Step 6: Valid Host Range

Valid hosts = everything between network and broadcast:

$$
\text{First host: } 172.25.144.0 + 1 = \boxed{172.25.144.1}
$$

$$
\text{Last host: } 172.25.159.255 - 1 = \boxed{172.25.159.254}
$$


---

## ✅ Final Answer (Fully Calculated)

|Item|Value|
|---|---|
|Subnet Mask|`255.255.240.0` (/20)|
|Network Address|`172.25.144.0`|
|Broadcast Address|`172.25.159.255`|
|Valid Host Range|`172.25.144.1` – `172.25.159.254`|
|Total Hosts||

$$
2^{12} - 2 = 4094 \text{ valid hosts}
$$
