‚úÖ **Yes, you're correct!** While **Class A, B, and C are still used in learning**, the **actual IP allocation does not follow the class system anymore**. Instead, CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is used, but there is still a **new way to categorize networks**, similar to how classes used to work.

## **üîπ So What Replaced "Classes" in the Real World?**

Even though **Class A, B, C are no longer used for IP allocation**, networks are still **grouped in a way that works like classes**, but based on **CIDR block sizes**.

Here‚Äôs the **new way** IP networks are distinguished:

|**Old Class System**|**CIDR Equivalent**|**Common Use**|
|---|---|---|
|**Class A** (`/8`)|**Large Blocks (`/8 ‚Äì /15`)**|ISPs, Large Enterprises, Cloud Providers|
|**Class B** (`/16`)|**Medium Blocks (`/16 ‚Äì /23`)**|Universities, Medium Businesses|
|**Class C** (`/24`)|**Small Blocks (`/24 ‚Äì /30`)**|Small Offices, Home Networks|
|**Class D (Multicast)**|**Still Exists (`224.0.0.0/4`)**|Used for Multicast|
|**Class E (Experimental)**|**Still Reserved (`240.0.0.0/4`)**|Research & Future Use|

üìå **CIDR gives flexibility**‚Äîinstead of being forced into Class A/B/C, networks now get the exact block size they need.

## **üîπ How Networks Are Now Categorized (Without Classes)**

Instead of saying **‚ÄúClass A‚Äù or ‚ÄúClass B‚Äù**, networking professionals now **group networks based on CIDR prefixes**, such as:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Small Networks**

- **CIDR Size:** `/24 ‚Äì /30`
- **Usable Hosts:** 1 ‚Äì 254
- **Used For:** Home networks, small offices, branch offices
- **Example:** `192.168.1.0/24`

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Medium Networks**

- **CIDR Size:** `/16 ‚Äì /23`
- **Usable Hosts:** 512 ‚Äì 65,534
- **Used For:** Universities, mid-size businesses
- **Example:** `172.16.0.0/16`

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Large Networks**

- **CIDR Size:** `/8 ‚Äì /15`
- **Usable Hosts:** 65,536 ‚Äì 16 million
- **Used For:** ISPs, large enterprises, cloud providers
- **Example:** `10.0.0.0/8`

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Multicast Networks**

- **CIDR Size:** `/4` (`224.0.0.0/4`)
- **Used For:** Multicast streaming, VoIP, gaming servers

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Experimental Networks**

- **CIDR Size:** `/4` (`240.0.0.0/4`)
- **Used For:** Reserved, research, future technologies

## **üîπ Why Did They Stop Using "Class A/B/C" and Switch to CIDR?**

‚úî **More Efficient Use of IPv4 Addresses**

- With classful addressing, **large blocks of IPs were wasted** (e.g., an organization might get a whole **Class B (`/16`)** but only need 5,000 IPs).
- CIDR allows **ISPs to allocate exact block sizes** (e.g., `192.168.10.0/22` instead of a full `/16`).

‚úî **Better Internet Routing**

- Before CIDR, routers had to handle **huge routing tables** with **fixed-size Class A/B/C networks**.
- CIDR allows **aggregation (supernetting)** to keep routing tables smaller.
- Example: Instead of 16 separate `/24` networks, an ISP can just announce **one `/20`**.

‚úî **IPv4 Address Exhaustion**

- IPv4 is **running out of addresses**. CIDR **helps save IPs** by preventing waste.
- Example: Instead of giving a company a full **Class B (`/16`, 65,536 IPs)**, CIDR allows giving them just **what they need (`/20`, 4,096 IPs)**.

## **üîπ Final Answer to Your Question**

‚úÖ **Class A, B, C, D, and E still exist in terminology, but they are not used for actual IP allocation.**  
‚úÖ **CIDR replaced class-based addressing, but networks are still categorized by block sizes (`/8`, `/16`, `/24`, etc.).**  
‚úÖ **Instead of calling a network "Class A", we now say it is a `/8`, `/12`, or `/16` network.**  
‚úÖ **Multicast (Class D) and Reserved (Class E) still exist, but they were never part of host IP allocations.**

üìå **So in summary: Class-based IPs are only used for learning. In real life, everything is CIDR-based, but network sizes still follow a structured way, just without calling them "classes".**
