### **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) Explained in Simple Terms**

CIDR, or **Classless Inter-Domain Routing**, is a method of **IP address allocation and routing** that replaced the **older classful addressing system** to make better use of IPv4 addresses and improve network efficiency.

Before CIDR, IP addresses were assigned in **fixed blocks** known as **Class A, B, and C**, which led to **massive address waste** because organizations received far more IP addresses than they actually needed. CIDR solved this problem by **removing the rigid class structure** and allowing **flexible subnetting** with variable-sized address blocks.

### **How CIDR Works**

Instead of **fixed subnet masks** (e.g., Class A = `/8`, Class B = `/16`, Class C = `/24`), CIDR allows **custom subnet masks** (e.g., `/20`, `/22`, `/27`) that match the organization's **actual IP address needs**.

For example:

- **Without CIDR**: A company needing **500 IP addresses** would be assigned a **Class B block**, which contains **65,534 addresses**â€”wasting over **65,000 addresses**.
- **With CIDR**: The company can now be assigned a **smaller block**, such as **192.168.1.0/23**, which provides **512 IPs**, perfectly matching their needs **without wasting addresses**.

### **CIDR Benefits**

1. **Prevents IPv4 Address Waste** â€“ Organizations only receive the number of IPs they actually need.
2. **Allows Efficient Routing (Route Summarization)** â€“ Multiple small networks can be grouped into a **single summarized route**, reducing router processing load.
3. **Supports Variable Subnetting (VLSM)** â€“ Networks can be **subdivided into different-sized subnets** based on internal requirements.
4. **Improves Internet Scalability** â€“ CIDR delayed **IPv4 exhaustion**, making the internet **more efficient and sustainable**.

### **CIDR in Action (Route Summarization)**

If an **ISP assigns** multiple `/24` blocks to different customers (e.g., `175.10.1.0/24`, `175.10.2.0/24`...), instead of **advertising hundreds of individual networks**, CIDR allows them to advertise **one summarized route**:

âœ… **175.10.0.0/16** â†’ Covers all smaller networks, reducing routing complexity.

This makes networks **faster, more stable, and easier to manage**.

### **Key Takeaways**

- CIDR **replaced the inefficient classful addressing system** to **better utilize IPv4 space**.
- It allows **IP addresses to be assigned in blocks that match actual needs**, preventing waste.
- It enables **route summarization**, reducing the number of routes stored in **router tables**, improving network performance.
- CIDR is **essential for modern networking**, making IPv4 **more efficient and scalable**.
