### **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) â€“ Detailed Explanation**

---

## **1. What is CIDR?**

CIDR (**Classless Inter-Domain Routing**) is an **IP addressing method** that replaces the traditional **classful addressing system** to allow **more efficient allocation of IP addresses** and **reduce waste**.

Before CIDR, IP addresses were assigned in **fixed classful blocks**:

- **Class A:** `/8` (16 million+ hosts per network)
- **Class B:** `/16` (65,534 hosts per network)
- **Class C:** `/24` (254 hosts per network)

This caused **significant address waste**. **CIDR was introduced in 1993** to allow **flexible subnetting** and **better use of available IP space**.

âœ… **CIDR allows IP networks to be divided into smaller or larger subnet sizes based on need rather than fixed class boundaries.**

---

## **2. Why Was CIDR Introduced?**

### **Problems with Classful Addressing**

1. **Wasted IP addresses**
    
    - If a company needed **500 IP addresses**, a **Class C (/24) was too small (254 hosts)**, so they had to receive a **Class B (/16), which supports 65,534 hosts**, wasting **thousands of IPs**.
2. **IPv4 Address Exhaustion**
    
    - IPv4 only has **4.3 billion addresses**, and inefficient allocation **accelerated address depletion**.
3. **Large Routing Tables**
    
    - Each individual network required a separate entry in routing tables, making **internet routing inefficient**.

âœ… **CIDR solves these problems by allowing networks to be divided into customized subnet sizes and aggregated to improve routing efficiency.**

---

## **3. How CIDR Works**

### **CIDR Removes Fixed Subnet Masks**

- Instead of Class A **always using /8**, Class B **always using /16**, and Class C **always using /24**, CIDR allows networks to use **any subnet mask** based on actual needs.
- Example:
    - Instead of assigning **175.10.0.0/16**, an ISP can now assign **175.10.10.0/20** (4096 addresses) to a company, leaving **more addresses for other companies**.

âœ… **CIDR enables flexible allocation by allowing subnet masks like /10, /12, /22, etc., instead of being forced into /8, /16, or /24.**

---

### **4. CIDR Notation (Slash Notation)**

CIDR uses **slash notation (/) to indicate the subnet mask** instead of traditional classful subnet masks.

- **/8 â†’ 255.0.0.0** (16 million+ hosts)
- **/16 â†’ 255.255.0.0** (65,534 hosts)
- **/24 â†’ 255.255.255.0** (254 hosts)
- **/20 â†’ 255.255.240.0** (4096 hosts)

âœ… **Slash notation makes it easier to read and configure subnets efficiently.**

## **5. CIDR and Route Summarization (Aggregation)**

### **What is Route Summarization?**

Without CIDR, ISPs had to **advertise hundreds of small networks**, increasing **routing table size**.  
CIDR allows **multiple small networks to be summarized into a single routing entry**, reducing routing complexity.

âœ… **Example:**

- ISP A assigns **175.10.0.0/24, 175.10.1.0/24, ..., 175.10.255.0/24** to customers.
- Instead of advertising **256 separate /24 networks**, ISP A can **summarize them into a single route: 175.10.0.0/16**.
- ISP B does the same with **175.11.0.0/16**.

âœ… **Benefit:**

- **Smaller routing tables** â†’ Faster and more efficient routing.
- **Less memory usage on routers**.
- **Isolates local network failures from affecting the entire internet.**

---

## **6. CIDR vs. VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking)**

- **CIDR** is used by **ISPs** to allocate IPs efficiently across the **internet**.
- **VLSM** is used **inside an organization** to divide a large subnet into **smaller subnets of different sizes**.

âœ… **Both CIDR and VLSM allow flexible subnetting beyond traditional classful boundaries.**

---

## **7. Benefits of CIDR**

1. **Efficient IP Address Allocation**
    
    - Organizations get **only the number of addresses they need**, reducing waste.
2. **Prevents IPv4 Exhaustion**
    
    - More addresses remain available for **future networks**.
3. **Supports Route Summarization**
    
    - **Reduces routing table size** and **improves network stability**.
4. **Allows for More Granular Subnetting**
    
    - Networks can use **custom subnet masks** instead of being forced into rigid classful sizes.
5. **Enhances Internet Scalability**
    
    - CIDR helped **delay the need for IPv6** by making **IPv4 address use more efficient**.

## **8. Key Takeaways**

1. **CIDR replaced the old classful addressing system** to allow **flexible subnetting**.
2. **CIDR prevents IP waste by assigning address blocks based on actual needs.**
3. **CIDR enables route summarization, which reduces routing table size and improves efficiency.**
4. **ISPs now allocate subnet masks like /20, /22, /26 instead of full Class A, B, or C blocks.**
5. **CIDR and VLSM allow for better IP address management both on the internet and within organizations.**
