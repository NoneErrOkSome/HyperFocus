You're correct to question why the transcript still refers to **Class C** when discussing subnetting. In modern networking, the **classful addressing system (Class A, B, C, etc.) is obsolete** and has been replaced by **Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)**. However, there are reasons why some materials still reference **Class C** and other address classes:

### 1. **Historical Context for Learning**

- When subnetting was first introduced, **IPv4 addresses were allocated based on classes** (A, B, C). Class C was commonly used for small networks, and the notation **/24** was the default subnet mask for Class C.
- Many instructors use **Class C as a teaching tool** because it's simple: it has **8 host bits**, making subnetting calculations easier.

### 2. **Familiarity in CCNA and Certification Exams**

- The **CCNA exam still references classes** in subnetting discussions, even though networks now use CIDR.
- Many training materials and courses **use Class C examples** because they align with **legacy knowledge** and help with subnetting exercises.

### 3. **Real-World Applications**

- While ISPs and enterprise networks use **CIDR and VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking)**, **some smaller networks or legacy systems may still think in terms of "Class C-like" addressing**.
- For example, when designing internal private networks, a **/24 subnet (historically Class C)** is still a common choice because it provides **254 usable addresses** (2²⁴ - 2).

### 4. **Subnetting Practice & Simplicity**

- Subnetting calculations for **Class C (/24, /25, /26, etc.)** are easier to understand and memorize.
- Moving the subnet mask from **/24 to /28** (as in the lecture) is a common step for **breaking a single network into smaller subnets**.

### **What You Should Take Away**

- **Class C isn't used in real-world networking for address allocation anymore**, but it **helps illustrate subnetting concepts**.
- **CIDR notation (/8, /16, /24, etc.) is the modern standard** for subnetting.
- When studying for **CCNA**, expect references to Class A, B, and C, but **in real network designs, focus on CIDR and subnet masks**.

Would you like a more practical approach to subnetting with **real-world CIDR examples** rather than class-based explanations?
