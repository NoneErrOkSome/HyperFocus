Here’s a **step-by-step breakdown** of the **“Subnetting on the 4th Octet”** example from the file you uploaded, simplified and explained clearly 👇

---

### 📌 **Given:**

- **IP Address:** `172.19.216.50`
- **Subnet Mask:** `255.255.255.240`

---

### 🧠 **Step 1: Understand which octet we are subnetting on**

- Subnet mask: `255.255.255.240`
- First 3 octets are all `255`, meaning they are fixed (no subnetting there).
- The **4th octet** is `240`, so that’s where we are doing the subnetting.

That’s why we write the address like this:

```
172.19.216.50/28
```

Because `255.255.255.240` = `/28` (means 28 bits are for the network).

---

### 🔢 **Step 2: Convert the subnet mask (240) to binary and count bits**

The 4th octet of the subnet mask is `240`. Let’s break that down using binary bit positions:

|Bit Position|128|64|32|16|8|4|2|1|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Binary Value|1|1|1|1|0|0|0|0|

So:

```
128 + 64 = 192
192 + 32 = 224
224 + 16 = 240 ✅
```

➡️ That means **the first 4 bits are for the network**, and **the last 4 bits are for hosts**.

---

### 🧮 **Step 3: Find the block size**

We are borrowing 4 bits in the 4th octet → That gives **2⁴ = 16** subnets.

Block size = **2⁴ = 16**

So subnets go in jumps of 16 in the 4th octet:

```
172.19.216.0
172.19.216.16
172.19.216.32
172.19.216.48 ✅ ← this is our subnet
172.19.216.64
...
```

➡️ `172.19.216.50` lies **between 48 and 64**, so:

- **Network Address = 172.19.216.48**

---

### 📡 **Step 4: Find the broadcast address**

Broadcast address = **1 less than the next network address**

- Next network: `172.19.216.64`
- So, **Broadcast = 172.19.216.63**

---

### 👥 **Step 5: Find the valid host range**

Valid host range = from **(network + 1)** to **(broadcast - 1)**

- Network: `172.19.216.48`
- Broadcast: `172.19.216.63`

Valid hosts:

```
172.19.216.49 → 172.19.216.62
```

---

### ✅ **Final Answers**

|Category|Address|
|---|---|
|Network Address|`172.19.216.48`|
|Broadcast Address|`172.19.216.63`|
|Valid Host Range|`172.19.216.49 – 62`|
