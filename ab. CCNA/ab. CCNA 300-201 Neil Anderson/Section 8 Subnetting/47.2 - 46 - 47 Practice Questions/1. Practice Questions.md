Great! Since you've studied the VLSM examples from:

- ‚úÖ **08-06-VLSM-Example-Part-1.pdf** (New York & Boston Engineering)
- ‚úÖ **08-07-VLSM-Example-Part-2.pdf** (Sales and point-to-point link)

I'll give you a fresh VLSM design challenge in a **different scenario** to help you practice. Here's your new scenario:

---

## üß† **Practice Problem ‚Äì VLSM Scenario**

### **Allocated Network Block:**

`192.168.50.0/24`

### **Subnet Requirements:**

|Location|Purpose|Required Hosts|
|---|---|---|
|San Francisco|Research Department|50|
|San Francisco|Admin Department|12|
|Los Angeles|Sales Department|20|
|Los Angeles|Marketing Department|8|
|Point-to-Point Link|SF ‚Üî LA Routers|2|

## üéØ **Your Tasks:**

1. **Determine the optimal subnet mask for each subnet.**
2. **Assign each subnet a unique network address from `192.168.50.0/24`.**
3. **Write down:**
    - Network address
    - Broadcast address
    - Valid host IP range

‚ö†Ô∏è Use **smallest possible subnets** for each while conserving address space.
