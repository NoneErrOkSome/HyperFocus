### **Part 2: Finding the Network Address, Broadcast Address & Usable Hosts**

Now that we have determined the **subnet mask (`255.255.255.192`)** and the **subnet increment (`64`)**, we can calculate:  
âœ… **Network Address**  
âœ… **Broadcast Address**  
âœ… **Usable Host Range**

---

## **1. Finding the Network Address**

The **network address** is always the **first IP** in the subnet range.

Given IP: **198.22.45.173/26**

- We know that `/26` **subnet increments by 64**:
    
    ```
    198.22.45.0     â†’ 198.22.45.63
    198.22.45.64    â†’ 198.22.45.127
    198.22.45.128   â†’ 198.22.45.191
    198.22.45.192   â†’ 198.22.45.255
    ```
    
- The given IP **198.22.45.173** falls between **198.22.45.128 â€“ 198.22.45.191**.
    
- **Network Address = First IP in this range** â†’ **`198.22.45.128`**
    

âœ… **Network Address: `198.22.45.128`**

---

## **2. Finding the Broadcast Address**

The **broadcast address** is always the **last IP** in the subnet range.

- The **next subnet starts at `198.22.45.192`**.
    
- The **broadcast address is always 1 less than the next subnetâ€™s start address**:
    
    ```
    198.22.45.192 - 1 = 198.22.45.191
    ```
    

âœ… **Broadcast Address: `198.22.45.191`**

---

## **3. Finding the Usable Host Range**

The **usable host range** includes all IPs **between the network and broadcast addresses**.

- **First usable IP:**
    
    ```
    Network Address + 1 = 198.22.45.128 + 1 = 198.22.45.129
    ```
    
- **Last usable IP:**
    
    ```
    Broadcast Address - 1 = 198.22.45.191 - 1 = 198.22.45.190
    ```
    

âœ… **Usable Host Range: `198.22.45.129 â€“ 198.22.45.190` (62 usable hosts)**

### **4. Summary of Part 2**

|**Type**|**IP Address**|
|---|---|
|**Network Address**|`198.22.45.128`|
|**Usable Hosts**|`198.22.45.129 â€“ 198.22.45.190`|
|**Broadcast Address**|`198.22.45.191`|
