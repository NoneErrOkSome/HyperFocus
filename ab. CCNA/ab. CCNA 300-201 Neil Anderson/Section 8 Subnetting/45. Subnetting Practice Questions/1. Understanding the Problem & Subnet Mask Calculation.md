### **Part 1: Understanding the Problem & Subnet Mask Calculation**

In this part, we will **understand the given subnetting problem**, determine the **subnet mask in dotted decimal format**, and explain **why the subnet increment is 64** for a **/26 subnet mask**.

---

## **1. Understanding the Given Problem**

We are given the **IP address: 198.22.45.173/26**, and we need to determine:  
âœ… The **subnet mask** in dotted decimal notation.  
âœ… The **network address, broadcast address, and usable host range**.

Before calculating those, letâ€™s first determine **what /26 means** in terms of subnetting.

---

## **2. Convert /26 into a Subnet Mask**

The CIDR notation **/26** means that **26 bits** are used for the **network portion**, and the remaining **6 bits** are used for **hosts**.

### **Step 1: Convert /26 to Binary**

IPv4 addresses are **32-bit binary numbers**, divided into **four octets** (each 8 bits).  
For a **/26 subnet mask**, the first **26 bits are 1s (network portion)**, and the remaining **6 bits are 0s (host portion)**.

|**Octet**|**Binary Representation**|**Decimal Equivalent**|
|---|---|---|
|**First**|`11111111`|`255`|
|**Second**|`11111111`|`255`|
|**Third**|`11111111`|`255`|
|**Fourth**|`11000000`|`192`|

ðŸ”¹ The last **two bits (00)** in the fourth octet belong to **hosts**.  
ðŸ”¹ The **remaining 26 bits (1s)** define the **network**.

### **Step 2: Convert to Dotted Decimal Notation**

The **binary subnet mask** is:

```
11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000
```

Converting to **decimal**:

```
255.255.255.192
```

âœ… **Subnet Mask in Dotted Decimal Notation = `255.255.255.192`**

---

## **3. Understanding the Subnet Increment (Why 64?)**

To determine **subnet increments**, we use the **last octet** of the subnet mask:

SubnetÂ Increment=256âˆ’LastÂ OctetÂ ofÂ SubnetÂ Mask\text{Subnet Increment} = 256 - \text{Last Octet of Subnet Mask}

For `/26`:

256âˆ’192=64256 - 192 = 64

ðŸ”¹ **This means each subnet starts at multiples of 64** in the fourth octet.  
ðŸ”¹ **The network addresses will increase by 64:**

```
198.22.45.0     â†’ 198.22.45.63
198.22.45.64    â†’ 198.22.45.127
198.22.45.128   â†’ 198.22.45.191
198.22.45.192   â†’ 198.22.45.255
```

âœ… **Each subnet contains 64 IPs (including network, hosts, and broadcast).**

---

## **4. Summary of Part 1**

âœ” **Subnet Mask in Dotted Decimal = `255.255.255.192`**  
âœ” **Subnet Increment = `64`** (Each subnet increases by 64 IPs).  
âœ” **The fourth octet of the subnet mask determines the subnet blocks**.

ðŸ“Œ **Next in Part 2:** We will calculate **network address, broadcast address, and usable host range** for **198.22.45.173/26**. ðŸš€
