✅ Great observation — and you're absolutely right to ask this!

Let’s break it down carefully because **what you saw is valid**, but it has **a specific reason** behind it.

---

## 🧠 **When Can You Start From `.0` Even If ISP Gave a Higher Address?**

There are **two possible scenarios**:

---

### ✅ **Scenario 1: The ISP Gave a Whole Block (e.g. `/24`, `/16`)**

**Example:**  
The ISP gives: `192.168.10.0/24`  
✔️ Starts at `.0`  
✔️ You can subnet freely from `.0` upward.

---

### ✅ **Scenario 2: The ISP Gave a Subnetted Block That Starts from a Non-Zero Address — But You Still Start from the _base_ of that block**

**Example:**  
The ISP gives: `192.168.10.64/26`

Technically:

- That block starts at `192.168.10.64`
- Because `/26` has **block size = 64**

So:

- Valid `/26` subnets are:
    - `192.168.10.0`
    - `192.168.10.64` ← your block
    - `192.168.10.128`

---

### 🔍 What the Instructor Probably Did:

If the ISP gave him `192.168.10.64/26`,  
he might have:

- **Listed all possible /26 subnets** in the class C block:
    - `.0`
    - `.64`
    - `.128`
- Then highlighted: “We're only using `.64/26`”

✅ That’s okay for teaching — but in real implementation, you can only **use what the ISP gave you** (in this case, `.64` as your starting point).

---

## ✅ Final Answer

> If the ISP gives you a **full block**, you **start from `.0`**  
> If the ISP gives you a **smaller block that starts mid-range**, you **start from that given IP**

Would you like me to visually show both cases side by side?
