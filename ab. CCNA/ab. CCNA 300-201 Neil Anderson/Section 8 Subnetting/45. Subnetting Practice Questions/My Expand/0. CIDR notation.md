âœ… **The notation "/xx" is called "CIDR notation" (Classless Inter-Domain Routing notation).**

---

## **1. What Does `/xx` Mean?**

- The `/xx` **specifies the number of bits used for the network portion** of an IP address.
- The remaining bits are used for **hosts (devices, nodes).**

ðŸ”¹ **Example: `/24`**

- **/24** means **the first 24 bits are for the network**.
- The **last 8 bits are for hosts**.
- **Subnet Mask:** `255.255.255.0`
- **Usable Hosts:**

$$
2^8 - 2 = 254
$$

## âœ… **2. CIDR Notation vs. Subnet Mask**

CIDR notation (`/xx`) is just a **shorter way** to write the subnet mask.

|**CIDR Notation (`/xx`)**|**Subnet Mask**|**Usable Hosts**|
|---|---|---|
|`/8`|`255.0.0.0`|$2^{24} - 2 = 16,777,214$|
|`/10`|`255.192.0.0`|$2^{22} - 2 = 4,194,302$|
|`/13`|`255.248.0.0`|$2^{19} - 2 = 524,286$|
|`/16`|`255.255.0.0`|$2^{16} - 2 = 65,534$|
|`/19`|`255.255.224.0`|$2^{13} - 2 = 8,190$|
|`/21`|`255.255.248.0`|$2^{11} - 2 = 2,046$|
|`/24`|`255.255.255.0`|$2^8 - 2 = 254$|
|`/25`|`255.255.255.128`|$2^7 - 2 = 126$|
|`/27`|`255.255.255.224`|$2^5 - 2 = 30$|
|`/30`|`255.255.255.252`|$2^2 - 2 = 2$|

âœ… **CIDR notation makes subnetting easier and more efficient to interpret.**

---

## **3. Why Use CIDR Notation Instead of Classful Addressing?**

ðŸ”¹ **CIDR allows flexible subnetting** instead of being limited to Class A, B, or C.  
ðŸ”¹ **Shorter and easier to write** compared to `255.255.255.192`.  
ðŸ”¹ **Used in modern networking & routing tables** (ISPs, enterprise networks).

## **4. Final Answer**

âœ” **"/xx" is called CIDR notation.**  
âœ” **It represents the number of network bits in the subnet mask.**  
âœ” **It simplifies IP subnetting and routing.**
âœ” **Subnet masks define the boundary between network and host bits, which is needed for subnetting.**
