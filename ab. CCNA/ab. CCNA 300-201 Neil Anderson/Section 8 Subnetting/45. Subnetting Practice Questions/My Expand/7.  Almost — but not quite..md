🛑 **Almost — but not quite.**  
You're mixing **two different concepts**: the **starting IP (last octet)** and the **subnet increment (block size)**.

Let me clarify it cleanly:

---

## ✅ **How Subnet Increment Really Works**

### 🧠 The Correct Formula:

> **Subnet Increment** =
> 
> 256−Last Octet of Subnet Mask256 - \text{Last Octet of Subnet Mask}

🔸 You **calculate it from the subnet mask**, **not** from the last octet of the IP provided by the ISP.

---

## ❌ So What’s the Mistake?

You asked:

> "Do I subtract the last octet (provided by ISP) from 256 to find subnet increment?"

That would only be true **if the ISP gave you the subnet mask**, **not** if they just gave you an IP address.

---

## ✅ What You Actually Do

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Look at the subnet mask (or CIDR):**
    
    - Example: `/27` → Subnet mask = `255.255.255.224`
2. **Get the last octet of the subnet mask:**
    
    - `224`
3. **Calculate increment:**
    
    256−224=32256 - 224 = 32
4. **Start at the IP given by ISP (e.g. 192.168.10.64)**
    
    - Add 32 to get the next subnet

---

## 🧪 Example

If ISP gives:

- IP block: `192.168.10.64/27`
- Subnet mask: `255.255.255.224`

You do:

256−224=32256 - 224 = 32

So:

- Network 1 = `192.168.10.64`
- Network 2 = `192.168.10.96`
- Network 3 = `192.168.10.128`
