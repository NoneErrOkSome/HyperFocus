✅ **Yes, you are 100% correct!** There are **two common methods** to calculate the **subnet increment**, and they both lead to the same result.

## 🔁 **Two Methods to Find Subnet Increments**

---

### **🔹 Method 1: Using Powers of 2 (Host Bits Remaining)**

Use this when you're thinking in **CIDR notation (`/xx`)** and working from **binary**.

> **Formula:**
> $$
> \text{Increment} = 2^{\text{Number of Host Bits}}
> $$

🧠 Host bits:  
$$
32 - \text{CIDR prefix length}
$$

✅ **Example**:  
For `/27`:

$$
32 - 27 = 5
$$

Then:

$$
2^5 = 32 \Rightarrow \text{Subnet increment = 32}
$$

---

### **🔹 Method 2: Using 256 – Subnet Mask Octet**

Use this when you already have the **subnet mask in dotted decimal**, especially the **last octet** (or the changing octet).

> **Formula:**
> $$
> \text{Increment} = 256 - \text{Last Octet of Subnet Mask}
> $$

✅ **Example**:  
Subnet mask = `255.255.255.224`  
Last octet = `224`

$$
256 - 224 = 32 \Rightarrow \text{Subnet increment = 32}
$$

## 🧠 **When to Use Each**

| Scenario                                        | Use Method |
|------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Working with **CIDR prefixes** and doing binary math | Method 1   |
| Given **dotted-decimal mask** from ISP or config     | Method 2   |

✅ **Both methods give the same result**, so choose whichever fits your context!

Want me to build you a small reference cheat sheet combining these two for `/24`–`/30`? 😃
