✅ **Yes!** When we say **"usable hosts,"** we mean **devices** that can be assigned an IP address.

## **1. What Are "Usable Hosts" in a Subnet?**

🔹 **Usable hosts** are the IP addresses in a subnet that can be assigned to **devices** such as:

- **PCs** 🖥️
- **Laptops** 💻
- **Servers** 🖧
- **Printers** 🖨️
- **Routers** 🌐 (for interfaces that need an IP)
- **Switches** (only **if** they use Layer 3 features)
- **CCTV Cameras** 📹
- **IoT Devices** (Smart TVs, sensors, etc.)

---

## **2. What Are NOT Usable Hosts?**

🔹 Two IPs in every subnet **cannot be assigned to devices**: 1️⃣ **Network Address (First IP) → Identifies the subnet.**  
2️⃣ **Broadcast Address (Last IP) → Sends messages to all devices in the subnet.**

**Example: `/28` Subnet (`192.168.1.0/28`)**

|**IP Address**|**Purpose**|
|---|---|
|`192.168.1.0`|**Network Address (Not Usable)**|
|`192.168.1.1`|**Router**|
|`192.168.1.2`|**Server**|
|`192.168.1.3`|**PC**|
|`192.168.1.4`|**Laptop**|
|`192.168.1.5`|**Printer**|
|`192.168.1.6`|**Switch (Layer 3 Management IP)**|
|`192.168.1.7`|**CCTV Camera**|
|`192.168.1.8`|**Phone (VoIP)**|
|`192.168.1.9`|**Firewall**|
|`192.168.1.10`|**Smart TV**|
|`192.168.1.11`|**IoT Device**|
|`192.168.1.12`|**Wireless Access Point**|
|`192.168.1.13`|**Backup Server**|
|`192.168.1.14`|**Test PC**|
|`192.168.1.15`|**Broadcast Address (Not Usable)**|

✅ **This subnet has 14 usable hosts, meaning 14 devices can get an IP.**

## **3. Final Answer**

✔ **Yes, "usable hosts" means IPs that can be assigned to devices like PCs, routers, switches, and printers.**  
✔ **Network & broadcast addresses cannot be assigned to devices.**  
✔ **Each subnet has a limited number of devices it can support.**
