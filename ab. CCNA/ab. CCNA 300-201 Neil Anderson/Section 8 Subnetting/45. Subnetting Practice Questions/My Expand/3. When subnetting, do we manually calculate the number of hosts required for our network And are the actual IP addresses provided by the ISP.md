When subnetting, do we manually calculate the number of hosts required for our network? And are the actual IP addresses provided by the ISP?

âœ… **Yes, you are correct!**

### **1. How Subnetting Works**

- **Subnetting is done by network administrators** within an organization.
- **You calculate how many hosts (devices) you need** and choose the correct subnet mask (`/xx`).
- **Subnetting helps divide a larger IP block into smaller subnets** to efficiently use IPs.

### **2. Who Assigns IP Addresses?**

There are **two types of IP address assignments**:

#### **A. Public IPs (Assigned by ISP)**

- **Your ISP (Internet Service Provider) assigns you a public IP range.**
- ISPs get large blocks from **Regional Internet Registries (RIRs)** like ARIN, RIPE, or APNIC.
- Example:
    - Your ISP gives you **`200.15.10.0/24`** (256 public IPs).
    - You **subnet it** inside your organization.

#### **B. Private IPs (Assigned by You)**

- If you're **using private IPs (`10.x.x.x`, `192.168.x.x`, etc.)**, you **assign them yourself**.
- Example: A company uses **`192.168.1.0/24`** and subnets it into smaller networks:
    - `192.168.1.0/26` â†’ IT Department
    - `192.168.1.64/26` â†’ Sales
    - `192.168.1.128/26` â†’ HR

âœ… **You control private IPs, but ISPs control public IPs.**

### **3. Final Answer**

âœ” **You calculate subnets based on the number of hosts your network needs.**  
âœ” **Your ISP assigns you a public IP range.**  
âœ” **Inside your network, you subnet and assign IPs as needed.**
