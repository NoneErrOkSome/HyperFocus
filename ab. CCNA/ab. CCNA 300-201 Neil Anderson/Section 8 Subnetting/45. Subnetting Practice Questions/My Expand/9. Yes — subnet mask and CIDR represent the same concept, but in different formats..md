✅ **Yes — subnet mask and CIDR represent the same concept**, but in **different formats**.

Let’s break it down clearly:

---

## 🧠 **CIDR vs Subnet Mask**

|Term|Format|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**CIDR**|Slash notation|`/24`, `/26`, `/30`|
|**Subnet Mask**|Dotted decimal|`255.255.255.0`|

✅ **They both mean**:

> “How many bits are used for the network portion of the IP address”

---

## 🔁 **Conversion Examples**

|CIDR Notation|Subnet Mask|Host Bits|Usable Hosts|
|---|---|---|---|
|`/24`|`255.255.255.0`|8|$2^8 - 2 = 254$|
|`/26`|`255.255.255.192`|6|$2^6 - 2 = 62$|
|`/30`|`255.255.255.252`|2|$2^2 - 2 = 2$|

---

## ✅ So Yes:

> **CIDR is just a shorter, cleaner way to write the subnet mask.**  
> The two are functionally the same in subnetting.
