✅ **Yes! Now you’ve got it — here’s the corrected understanding:**

---

## ✅ **You Use the IP Address Given by the ISP As the Starting Point**,

Then **Add the Subnet Increment (from the subnet mask)** to find:

- The **next network address**
- The **length** (range) of each subnet block
- The **broadcast address**
- The **usable host range**

---

## 🔁 **You DO NOT calculate the increment from the IP address itself**

You calculate it from the **subnet mask or CIDR**, like this:

> **Subnet Increment** =
> 
> 256−last octet of subnet mask256 - \text{last octet of subnet mask}

---

## 🧠 Example

If ISP gives you:

- `192.168.10.64/27`
- Subnet mask: `255.255.255.224`

You calculate:

256−224=32(increment)256 - 224 = 32 \quad \text{(increment)}

Now use that increment **with the IP**:

|What|Value|
|---|---|
|Network address|`192.168.10.64`|
|Broadcast address|`192.168.10.95` (64 + 32 - 1)|
|Next subnet starts at|`192.168.10.96` (64 + 32)|
|Usable hosts|`192.168.10.65 – 192.168.10.94`|

### ✅ Final Answer

> You **start with the IP address given by the ISP**, and you **use the subnet increment** to calculate all the rest.

Would you like a table template where you can plug in your own CIDR and IP to calculate all of this?
