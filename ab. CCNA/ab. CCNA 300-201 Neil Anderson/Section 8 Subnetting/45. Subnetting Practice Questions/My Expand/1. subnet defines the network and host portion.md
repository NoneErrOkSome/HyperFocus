âœ… **Yes!** A **subnet mask** is used to determine **the number of usable hosts (devices, nodes) available in a network**.

However, the **subnet mask is not just about finding usable hosts**â€”it also **defines the network size**, **separates the network portion from the host portion**, and **determines how many subnets exist** within a larger network.

---

## **1. How Does a Subnet Mask Define Usable Hosts?**

Each **CIDR prefix (`/xx`)** tells us **how many bits are for the network** and **how many are for hosts**.

ðŸ”¹ **Formula for Total IPs in a Subnet:**
$$
2^{\text{Host Bits}}
$$

ðŸ”¹ **Formula for Usable Hosts:**
$$
(2^{\text{Host Bits}}) - 2
$$

(**We subtract 2 because the first IP is the network address, and the last IP is the broadcast address.**)

---

## **2. Examples of Usable Hosts for Different Subnet Masks**

Let's apply the formula to some common subnet masks.

### **Example 1: /23 (Subnet Mask: 255.255.254.0)**

- **Host Bits:** \( 32 - 23 = 9 \)
- **Total IPs:** 
$$
2^9 = 512
$$
- **Usable Hosts:** 
$$
512 - 2 = 510
$$

âœ… **A /23 subnet supports 510 usable devices.**

---

### **Example 2: /29 (Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.248)**

- **Host Bits:** \( 32 - 29 = 3 \)
- **Total IPs:** 
$$
2^3 = 8
$$
- **Usable Hosts:** 
$$
8 - 2 = 6
$$

âœ… **A /29 subnet supports 6 usable devices (good for small networks like point-to-point links or management subnets).**

---

### **Example 3: /28 (Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.240)**

- **Host Bits:** \( 32 - 28 = 4 \)
- **Total IPs:** 
$$
2^4 = 16
$$
- **Usable Hosts:** 
$$
16 - 2 = 14
$$

âœ… **A /28 subnet supports 14 usable devices.**

---

## **3. When Do You Choose a Specific Subnet Mask?**

You choose a subnet mask **based on how many devices you need to connect in that subnet**:

- **/30 or /31** â†’ Best for **point-to-point links** (2 devices).
- **/29 or /28** â†’ Best for **small office, router links, or server management networks**.
- **/24** â†’ Standard for **LANs, VLANs, and medium-sized networks** (254 hosts).
- **/22 or /23** â†’ Best for **large networks, Wi-Fi networks, enterprise environments** (512+ hosts).
- **/16** â†’ Best for **large corporate networks (65,534 hosts)**.

---

## **4. Final Answer**

âœ” **Yes, the subnet mask determines the number of usable hosts (devices/nodes) in a subnet.**  
âœ” **Each CIDR prefix (`/23`, `/29`, `/28`, etc.) tells us how many hosts are available.**  
âœ” **Choosing the right subnet mask depends on how many devices you need to support.**
