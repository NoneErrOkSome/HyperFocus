### **Part 3: Efficient Subnetting Methods & Why We Focus on the Last Octet**

In **Part 1**, we determined the **subnet mask (`/26` → `255.255.255.192`)** and the **subnet increment (`64`)**.  
In **Part 2**, we calculated the **network address (`198.22.45.128`)**, **broadcast address (`198.22.45.191`)**, and **usable hosts (`198.22.45.129 – 198.22.45.190`)**.

Now, let's explore **efficient subnetting techniques** and **why calculations focus only on the last octet**.

---

## **1. The Shortcut Method (Subnet Increment)**

Instead of converting everything to **binary**, we can quickly find **network and broadcast addresses** by using the **subnet increment**.

🔹 **Steps to Use the Shortcut Method**: 1️⃣ **Identify subnet increment** from the subnet mask:

- **`/26` → `256 - 192 = 64`** 2️⃣ **Find the subnet range that includes the given IP**:

```
198.22.45.0     → 198.22.45.63
198.22.45.64    → 198.22.45.127
198.22.45.128   → 198.22.45.191
198.22.45.192   → 198.22.45.255
```

3️⃣ **Find the network address (first IP in the subnet)**:

- Given **`198.22.45.173`**, which falls in **`198.22.45.128 - 198.22.45.191`**
- **Network Address = `198.22.45.128`** 4️⃣ **Find the broadcast address (last IP in the subnet)**:
- **Broadcast Address = `198.22.45.191`** 5️⃣ **Find the usable hosts**:
- **First usable host = `Network Address + 1`** → `198.22.45.129`
- **Last usable host = `Broadcast Address - 1`** → `198.22.45.190`

✅ **Using this shortcut avoids converting to binary and speeds up subnetting calculations.**

## **2. The Binary Method (For Verification)**

Although **binary conversion** is slower, it is useful for verifying results.

🔹 **Steps to Find Network & Broadcast Address in Binary:** 1️⃣ Convert **198.22.45.173** to **binary**:

```
11000110.00010110.00101101.10101101
```

2️⃣ Convert **subnet mask `/26`** to **binary**:

```
11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000
```

3️⃣ Apply the subnet mask to **identify the network portion**:

```
11000110.00010110.00101101.10 000000  → Network Address
11000110.00010110.00101101.10 111111  → Broadcast Address
```

4️⃣ Convert back to decimal:

- **Network Address:** `198.22.45.128`
- **Broadcast Address:** `198.22.45.191`

✅ **Binary confirms that our shortcut method was correct!**

## **3. Why Do We Only Focus on the Last Octet?**

In subnetting, we often **ignore the first three octets** because **subnetting only affects the last octet when using masks larger than `/24`**.

### **Example: `/26` Subnet Mask**

- The first **three octets (198.22.45.XXX)** remain unchanged.
- **Only the fourth octet changes** because subnetting happens in the **last 6 bits** (`/26` → `11000000`).
- This means **calculations are only based on the last octet**.

🔹 **Subnet increments apply only to the last octet unless we subnet beyond `/24` (like `/16` or `/22`).**  
🔹 **This saves time when calculating subnet addresses, making subnetting faster.**

## **4. Final Summary of Part 3**

✔ **The subnet increment method is the fastest way to calculate network, broadcast, and host addresses.**  
✔ **Binary conversion can be used for verification but is not necessary for quick calculations.**  
✔ **Subnetting within `/24` only affects the last octet, simplifying calculations.**
