To **summarize all details** while keeping it **structured and clear**, I will break it down into **three parts**:

---

### **Part 1: Understanding the Problem & Subnet Mask Calculation**

- Given IP: **198.22.45.173/26**
- Determine **subnet mask** in **dotted decimal notation**.
- Explain **why /26 has a subnet increment of 64**.

---

### **Part 2: Finding Network Address, Broadcast Address & Usable Hosts**

- Calculate **network address** based on **subnet increment**.
- Determine **broadcast address** by finding the **last IP in the subnet**.
- Identify **usable host range**.

---

### **Part 3: Efficient Subnetting Method (Shortcut)**

- Use **increment method** to quickly find **network and broadcast addresses**.
- Compare with the **binary method** for verification.
- Explain **why subnet calculations focus only on the last octet**.
