To fully explain **Part 2 of the full lecture** — the complete HTTP request journey from Host A to the Web Server through multiple routers and subnets — I would break it down into **five parts** due to the complexity and layered nature of what's happening at every hop.

---

### 🔁 **Part 1: Host A Composes and Sends the HTTP Request**

- How the OSI stack is completed now that the IP is known
    
- Source/destination MAC and IP at the first hop
    
- Host A sends the HTTP request to its default gateway
    

---

### 🌐 **Part 2: Router A Forwards to Router B via Static Route**

- Router A uses a static route to reach `10.10.12.0/24`
    
- ARP request for Router B’s MAC (`10.10.11.2`)
    
- Router A forwards the HTTP request to Router B
    

---

### 🛰️ **Part 3: Router B Resolves the Web Server’s MAC**

- ARP request for Web Server at `10.10.12.10`
    
- Switch 2 floods ARP, Web Server responds
    
- Router B sends HTTP request to Web Server
    

---

### 🧠 **Part 4: Web Server Processes the HTTP Request**

- Web Server receives and processes packet
    
- OSI stack processing (Layer 2 → Layer 7)
    
- Recognizes the packet as TCP port 80 (HTTP)
    

---

### ⚡ **Part 5: Subsequent Packets Use ARP and MAC Cache**

- No more ARP needed after first exchange
    
- MAC address and IP resolution is now cached
    
- Flow is continuous and efficient for the rest of the session

Let me know when you’d like to begin with **Part 1**, and I’ll walk you through the packet’s journey in full clarity.
