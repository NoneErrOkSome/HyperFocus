# 🛰️ Part 2: ARP Operation Within the Same Subnet

When two devices on the same IP subnet need to communicate, **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** is used to discover the **MAC address** associated with the **destination IP**. This part explains **how the ARP process works step by step**, what kind of frames are sent, and how switches behave during the process.

---

## 🖧 Scenario Setup

Let’s say we have two devices on the same subnet:

|Device|IP Address|MAC Address|
|---|---|---|
|Sender|172.23.4.1|1111.2222.3333|
|Receiver|172.23.4.2|2222.3333.4444|

The **sender wants to send traffic** (e.g., ping, TCP/UDP data) to the receiver, but it **only knows the IP**, not the MAC address.

## 🧱 Step-by-Step: ARP Process

### 1. 🔍 Sender Has the Destination IP But Not the MAC

- It builds the IP packet (Layer 3) with:
    
    - Source IP: `172.23.4.1`
        
    - Destination IP: `172.23.4.2`
        
- But it **can’t complete the Ethernet frame** (Layer 2) because it doesn’t yet know the **destination MAC address**.
    

### 2. 📣 ARP Request Is Sent

- The sender **broadcasts** a Layer 2 frame:
    
    - **Source MAC**: 1111.2222.3333
        
    - **Destination MAC**: `FFFF.FFFF.FFFF` (broadcast)
        
- The payload contains a message like:
    
    ```
    "Who has 172.23.4.2? Tell 172.23.4.1"
    ```
    

### 3. 🪄 Switch Behavior

- The switch sees the **broadcast** and floods the frame out **all active ports** (except the incoming one)
    
- All hosts on the subnet receive it
    

### 4. 📨 Receiver Matches the IP

- The receiver (172.23.4.2) sees the ARP request
    
- It recognizes that **this IP is its own**
    
- It replies with a **unicast ARP reply** to the sender:
    
    - **Source MAC**: 2222.3333.4444
        
    - **Destination MAC**: 1111.2222.3333
        
    - Payload says:
        
        ```
        "I am 172.23.4.2, and my MAC is 2222.3333.4444"
        ```
        

### 5. 🎯 Sender Receives the ARP Reply

- The original sender receives the ARP reply
    
- Now it **knows the destination MAC**
    
- It can now send **normal unicast traffic** to the receiver (e.g., ping, TCP packet, etc.)

## 🧠 Key Concepts

|Concept|Meaning|
|---|---|
|ARP Request Type|Broadcast (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF)|
|ARP Reply Type|Unicast back to the original requester|
|Switch Behavior on Request|Floods the frame to all ports|
|Switch Behavior on Reply|Forwards based on MAC table (unicast)|
|Protocol Layer|Operates at Layer 2 (Ethernet frame with special payload)|
|IP & MAC Mapping Stored In|ARP Cache (temporary table inside the host OS)|

---

## 🧠 Optimization: ARP Caching

Once the sender learns the MAC address, it **caches** it so it doesn’t have to send an ARP request **every time**.

- Stored temporarily in an **ARP cache**
    
- If there’s no communication for a while, the entry **times out**
    
- New traffic will trigger a **new ARP request**

### 💬 Example ARP Message (Plain English)

**Sender Broadcasts**:

> “I’m looking for 172.23.4.2. Can anyone tell me the MAC address?”

**Receiver Replies**:

> “Yes, I’m 172.23.4.2 and my MAC address is 2222.3333.4444.”

## ✅ Summary – What You Should Know

|Action|Detail|
|---|---|
|ARP Request|Layer 2 broadcast: asks “who has this IP?”|
|ARP Reply|Layer 2 unicast: provides MAC for requested IP|
|Used when|Sender knows IP but not MAC (within same subnet)|
|Stored in|Local ARP cache|
|Involves a switch?|Yes, it floods requests and unicast-replies properly|
