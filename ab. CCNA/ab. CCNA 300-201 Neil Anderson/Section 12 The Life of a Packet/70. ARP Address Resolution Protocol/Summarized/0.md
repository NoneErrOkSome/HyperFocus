## üéØ **Goal: Understand How ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Works Between Two Hosts in the Same Subnet**

---

### üß† Why This Matters

When two devices are in the **same subnet** (a group of IP addresses within the same network range), they can talk **directly** ‚Äî but only if they know each other‚Äôs **MAC (Media Access Control) addresses**.

MAC addresses are hardware-level identifiers on Ethernet devices, and to find them, the sender uses **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**.

---

### üß© OSI Stack Context

Before traffic is sent, the device builds the packet using all **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** layers:

- **Layer 7 ‚Äì Application** (e.g., a ping command or web request)
    
- **Layer 6 ‚Äì Presentation** (formats or encrypts data)
    
- **Layer 5 ‚Äì Session** (establishes/maintains communication)
    
- **Layer 4 ‚Äì Transport** (adds TCP or UDP headers)
    
- **Layer 3 ‚Äì Network** (adds IP ‚Äì Internet Protocol ‚Äì addresses)
    
- **Layer 2 ‚Äì Data-Link** (adds MAC addresses using ARP)
    
- **Layer 1 ‚Äì Physical** (sends data as bits over wire/wireless)
    

üîó ARP operates at **Layer 2 (Data-Link)**.

### üõ∞Ô∏è What ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Actually Does

#### Problem:

> Host A knows the destination **IP (Internet Protocol) address**, but not the **MAC address** ‚Äî and Ethernet requires a MAC to send the frame.

#### Solution:

> ARP sends a **broadcast message** on the local network to ask: ‚ÄúWho has this IP? Please send me your MAC address.‚Äù

### üß™ Real Example:

|Device|IP Address|MAC Address|
|---|---|---|
|**Host A**|172.23.4.1|1111.2222.3333|
|**Host B**|172.23.4.2|2222.3333.4444|

1. **Host A** sends an **ARP Request**:
    
    - IP Target: `172.23.4.2`
        
    - MAC Destination: `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF` (Ethernet broadcast)
        
2. **The switch** receives the ARP broadcast and **floods** it out all ports.
    
3. **Host B** responds with an **ARP Reply**:
    
    - ‚ÄúI am `172.23.4.2`, my MAC is `2222.3333.4444`‚Äù
        
    - Sent directly (unicast) to Host A's MAC
        
4. **Host A** adds the entry to its **ARP cache**:
    
    ```
    172.23.4.2 ‚Üí 2222.3333.4444
    ```
    

Now Host A can send real traffic (like ICMP or TCP) directly.

### ‚úÖ Summary of Concepts (With Acronyms Expanded)

|Term / Command|Meaning / Purpose|
|---|---|
|**ARP**|Address Resolution Protocol ‚Äì finds MAC from IP within the same subnet|
|**MAC**|Media Access Control ‚Äì hardware address used at Layer 2 (Data-Link)|
|**IP**|Internet Protocol ‚Äì logical addressing at Layer 3 (Network Layer)|
|**OSI**|Open Systems Interconnection ‚Äì 7-layer networking model|
|**ICMP**|Internet Control Message Protocol ‚Äì used by ping/traceroute (optional here)|
|**TCP**|Transmission Control Protocol ‚Äì reliable, connection-oriented transport layer|
|**UDP**|User Datagram Protocol ‚Äì faster, connectionless transport layer|
