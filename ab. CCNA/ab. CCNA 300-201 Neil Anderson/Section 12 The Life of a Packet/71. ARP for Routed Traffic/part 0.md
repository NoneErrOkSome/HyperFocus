To fully explain the **ARP process for routed traffic** (when two hosts are on different IP subnets) in my own words—clearly and thoroughly, including both the **theory** and **lab example**—I would break it into **four parts**:

---

### 🧩 **Part 1: Why ARP Works Differently Across Subnets**

- Recap of same-subnet ARP
    
- Why ARP broadcasts don’t cross routers
    
- The role of the default gateway for inter-subnet traffic
    

---

### 🌐 **Part 2: Sender Resolves Default Gateway’s MAC and Sends the Packet**

- Host detects that the destination is outside its subnet
    
- Sends ARP request for the default gateway
    
- Forwards the packet to the router with destination MAC = gateway
    

---

### 🛰️ **Part 3: Router Resolves Destination MAC in Next Subnet and Forwards**

- Router receives packet, checks destination IP
    
- Performs ARP for final destination in new subnet
    
- Forwards packet to destination using updated MAC header
    

---

### 🖥️ **Part 4: Lab Example – Viewing and Verifying ARP on Cisco Routers**

- Use of `show arp` and `clear arp-cache`
    
- Example ARP tables on R1, R2, and R3
    
- How to read and interpret interface-level ARP entries

Let me know when you're ready for **Part 1**, and I’ll start with the full explanation.
