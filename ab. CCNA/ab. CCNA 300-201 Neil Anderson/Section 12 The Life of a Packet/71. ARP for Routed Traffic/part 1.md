# 🧩 Part 1: Why ARP Works Differently Across Subnets

---

## 🧠 Quick Recap – ARP in the Same Subnet

When two devices are on the **same IP subnet**, ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is simple:

1. The sender knows the **destination IP address**
    
2. It sends a **Layer 2 broadcast** (MAC `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`) asking:
    
    > “Who has this IP? Tell me your MAC.”
    
3. The target device responds with a **unicast reply**, giving its MAC
    
4. The sender stores that IP-to-MAC mapping in its **ARP cache**
    

✅ This works great **within a single subnet** because **broadcasts are local** — they don’t go beyond routers.

## 🌐 What Happens When Devices Are in Different Subnets?

Let’s say:

- **Sender IP**: `172.23.4.1` (in subnet `172.23.4.0/24`)
    
- **Destination IP**: `192.168.10.1` (in a completely different subnet)
    

The sender detects that the destination **is not local** by comparing:

- Its own IP and subnet mask (`/24`)
    
- The destination IP
    

📌 It sees: “We are in different subnets — I need to send this to my **default gateway**.”

---

## 🚫 Why Can’t the Sender Just ARP for the Destination?

If Host A tried to ARP directly for `192.168.10.1`, here’s what would happen:

- It would send a Layer 2 **broadcast**
    
- That broadcast would **stay in the local subnet** and **never reach the remote host**
    
- The destination host would **never see or reply** to the ARP request
    

So the communication would fail.

---

## 🧭 What Should the Sender Do Instead?

The sender **does not ARP for the destination IP**, it **ARPs for the default gateway**.

### 🔁 What Actually Happens:

1. Sender checks:
    
    - "Is the destination in my subnet?" → ❌ No
        
2. It sends a **Layer 2 broadcast ARP** for the **default gateway IP** (e.g., `172.23.4.254`)
    
3. Once it learns the **MAC address of the gateway**, it sends the packet:
    
    - **IP header**: From sender to final destination IP
        
    - **MAC header**: From sender to **gateway MAC**
        

---

## 🔍 Why This Works

The router (gateway) acts as a **hop** between subnets. It will:

- Receive the packet
    
- Examine the destination IP
    
- Route the packet toward the correct next hop
    
- Replace the MAC headers appropriately
    

So ARP is only ever used for **next-hop MAC resolution**, **never across subnets**.

## ✅ Summary – Key Concepts

|Concept|Explanation|
|---|---|
|ARP broadcast scope|Only within the sender's local subnet|
|Cross-subnet communication|Requires a router (default gateway)|
|Sender’s ARP target|Always the **gateway’s IP**, not the destination IP|
|MAC address used in Ethernet|Always the **MAC of the next-hop device** (router or destination host)|
|IP address used in packet|Still the final destination’s IP — it never changes|
