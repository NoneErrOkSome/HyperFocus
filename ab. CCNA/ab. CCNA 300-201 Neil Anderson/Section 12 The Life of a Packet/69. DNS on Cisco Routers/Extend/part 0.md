To fully explain **all the details** of this DNS configuration lesson on Cisco routers in my own words‚Äîincluding both the **theory** and the **lab demonstration**‚ÄîI'd divide it into **four parts**:

---

### üß© **Part 1: Why and When to Configure a Router as a DNS Client**

- What it means for a router to be a DNS client
    
- When it‚Äôs useful (e.g., for pinging hostnames from the router)
    
- Clarification: DNS client mode doesn‚Äôt affect DNS traffic **passing through** the router

### üõ†Ô∏è **Part 2: How to Configure a Cisco Router as a DNS Client**

- Commands required:
    
    - `ip domain-lookup`
        
    - `ip name-server [IP]`
        
    - `ip domain-name [primary domain]`
        
    - `ip domain-list [additional suffixes]`
        
- Use case for each command
    
- Example use: making a router resolve names like `r3.flackbox.lab`

### üñ•Ô∏è **Part 3: How to Configure a Cisco Router as a DNS Server**

- Extra commands:
    
    - `ip dns server`
        
    - `ip host [hostname] [IP]` (including FQDNs)
        
- Example setup on R3, with IPs assigned to R1, R2, R3
    
- Explanation of hostname-to-IP mapping in the DNS server

### üîÅ **Part 4: Testing DNS Resolution Between Routers**

- Setup:
    
    - R3 = DNS Server
        
    - R1 = DNS Client
        
- Commands used to test:
    
    - `ping [hostname]`
        
- Verifying successful DNS resolution from the router CLI
    
- Expected behavior and output interpretation
