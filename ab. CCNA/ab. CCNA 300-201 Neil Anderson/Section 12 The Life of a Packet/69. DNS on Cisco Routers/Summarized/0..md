Great question — let’s zoom out and get to the **whole point** of the transcript beyond just the list of commands:

---

### 🎯 **The Big Picture: Why We Did All This**

The transcript walks you through a **realistic lab scenario** to demonstrate how you can set up **DNS functionality on Cisco routers**, both as a **client** and a **server** — and more importantly, **why** you’d do it.

---

## 🧠 **Here’s the real purpose behind all of it:**

### 1. **Sometimes, we want a router to resolve hostnames**

- Normally, we ping devices using **IP addresses**.
    
- But what if you wanted to `ping linuxa.flackbox.lab` instead of memorizing the IP?
    
- For that, the router itself needs DNS resolution ability → this is what the **DNS Client setup** is for.
    

---

### 2. **Routers can also act as lightweight DNS servers**

- You may not have a Windows/Linux DNS server in a small lab or test network.
    
- So, you can make one of your Cisco routers act as a **basic DNS server**.
    
- This server can respond to queries like:
    
    > “What’s the IP of `R1.flackbox.lab`?”
    

---

### 3. **It shows internal DNS resolution in action**

- Inside an enterprise, internal hostnames (like `engineeringa.flackboxa.lab`) don’t go to Google DNS.
    
- They get resolved by an **internal DNS server**.
    
- This lab mimics that by having one router (R3) play the role of the internal DNS server.

### 4. **It's a practical test of name resolution in networks**

- This isn’t about full-blown DNS architecture.
    
- It’s about getting comfortable with how **hostname resolution works** in Cisco gear:
    
    - How a router **resolves names**
        
    - How it **responds to name requests**
        
    - And how it **tests** it with simple `ping` commands

## 🧾 Bottom Line

> 🧩 **This lab teaches you how to configure and test DNS functionality on routers so that devices can use names instead of IPs — just like how real internal networks work.**
