# üñ•Ô∏è Part 3: DNS in Practice ‚Äì Windows Client and DNS Server Lab

Now that we‚Äôve covered DNS theory and enterprise architecture, let‚Äôs look at how it works in **real-world practice** using a **Windows-based lab setup**. This part walks through what‚Äôs happening on the **client** and **server** side of DNS inside a local network.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Step 1: Checking the DNS Configuration on a Client (Windows)

The first step is to inspect the client‚Äôs network configuration to verify:

- IP address
    
- Subnet mask
    
- Default gateway
    
- DNS server
    
- DNS domain
    

You do this using the `ipconfig /all` command.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Command:

```cmd
ipconfig /all
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Output Example:

|Field|Value|
|---|---|
|IP Address|`172.23.1.10`|
|Subnet Mask|`255.255.255.0 (/24)`|
|Default Gateway (Router)|`172.23.1.254`|
|DNS Server|`172.23.4.1`|
|DNS Suffix (Domain)|`flackboxa.lab`|

This tells us the client is part of the `flackboxa.lab` domain and uses the internal DNS server at `172.23.4.1`.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíº Step 2: Exploring the Internal DNS Server (Windows Server)

On the **DNS server**, you can open **DNS Manager** through Server Manager.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Access DNS Manager:

1. Open **Server Manager**
    
2. Go to **Tools > DNS**
    

You‚Äôll see the server listed and its **authoritative zones**.

In this case, the DNS server is **authoritative** for:

```
flackboxa.lab
```

Meaning it owns and manages all the DNS records for this domain.

---

### üßæ Inside the DNS Zone: Host Records (A Records)

Inside the `flackboxa.lab` zone, the administrator has created **A (Address) records** for devices.

#### Example Records:

|Hostname|IP Address|
|---|---|
|engineeringa|`172.23.6.10`|
|engineeringb|`172.23.6.11`|
|linuxa|`172.23.4.2`|

These records allow internal clients to resolve names like:

- `linuxa.flackboxa.lab`
    
- `engineeringa.flackboxa.lab`
    

---

## üåê Step 3: DNS Forwarder Configuration

If a query is made for an external domain like `www.google.com`, this DNS server **won‚Äôt have that info**.

Instead, it should **forward** the request to a public DNS server.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è To Configure a Forwarder:

1. In DNS Manager, right-click the server name
    
2. Select **Properties**
    
3. Go to the **Forwarders** tab
    
4. Click **Edit** and enter the IP address of a public DNS server (e.g., `8.8.8.8`)
    

This lets internal clients reach Internet resources via DNS, even though the internal DNS server doesn‚Äôt have that data itself.

---

## üß™ Step 4: Testing DNS Resolution from the Client

Let‚Äôs test resolution using two commands: `nslookup` and `ping`.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Command 1: `nslookup linuxa`

```cmd
nslookup linuxa
```

This sends a DNS query to the configured DNS server (in our case, `172.23.4.1`).

‚úÖ Expected Result:

- DNS responds with `linuxa.flackboxa.lab`
    
- IP address is returned: `172.23.4.2`
    

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Command 2: `ping linuxa`

```cmd
ping linuxa
```

This verifies that the name has been resolved correctly. If the IP address appears and the ping is successful, DNS is working fine.

‚úÖ The device can now be reached by:

- Hostname (`linuxa`)
    
- FQDN (`linuxa.flackboxa.lab`)
    
- IP Address (`172.23.4.2`)

## ‚úÖ Summary of Part 3

|Step|Action|
|---|---|
|`ipconfig /all`|Shows DNS server, IP, and domain info on the client|
|DNS Manager in Windows|Manages zones and records for internal domain|
|A Records|Map hostnames to IP addresses inside the enterprise|
|Forwarders Tab|Set public DNS servers for unknown external domains|
|`nslookup` and `ping`|Test if DNS resolution works properly on the network|

Next up is **Part 4: Practical Testing and Validation** ‚Äî where we confirm name resolution using different name formats and explore what happens behind the scenes during DNS queries.
