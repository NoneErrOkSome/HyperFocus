To explain **all the details** of this lecture on DNS in my own words‚Äî**deep diving through both theory and lab demonstration**‚ÄîI would divide it into **four main parts**:

---

### üß© **Part 1: DNS Fundamentals and Its Place in the OSI Model**

- DNS‚Äôs role in name-to-IP resolution
    
- How it fits into the encapsulation process through OSI Layers
    
- Why DNS is needed for applications using FQDNs (like `www.cisco.com`)
    
- Brief intro to port numbers and protocols (UDP 53, TCP fallback)
    

---

### üß† **Part 2: Enterprise DNS Architecture**

- Internal DNS servers and domains (e.g., `flackbox.com`)
    
- Why internal DNS can‚Äôt resolve external domains
    
- How **forwarding** to public DNS servers works
    
- Real-world structure of DNS hierarchy

### üñ•Ô∏è **Part 3: DNS in Practice ‚Äì Windows Client and DNS Server Lab**

- Client-side: Checking DNS and IP info using `ipconfig /all`
    
- Server-side: Using Windows Server DNS Manager
    
    - Viewing authoritative zones (like `FlackboxA.lab`)
        
    - Preconfigured host records
        
    - Setting up **forwarders** to public DNS
        

---

### üîß **Part 4: Practical Testing and Validation**

- Running `nslookup` and `ping` to verify DNS resolution
    
- Resolution by hostname, FQDN, and direct IP
    
- Confirming DNS functionality on a local test network
