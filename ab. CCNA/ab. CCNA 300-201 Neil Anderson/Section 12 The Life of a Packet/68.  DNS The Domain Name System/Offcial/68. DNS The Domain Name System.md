Here’s a complete, structured deep dive into the **Domain Name System (DNS)**, explained in my own words but faithfully covering all aspects of your lecture:

# 🌍 DNS – Domain Name System Explained

DNS is a **critical service** that enables humans and applications to use **domain names** (like `www.cisco.com`) instead of numeric IP addresses (like `192.0.2.1`). It acts like the Internet’s **phonebook**, translating **Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs)** into usable IP addresses.

## 📦 Where DNS Fits in the OSI Model

DNS comes into play at the **Application Layer (Layer 7)**, but to truly understand its role, let’s trace a packet’s journey through the OSI stack:

### 🔁 Encapsulation Process:

1. **Layer 7 – Application**: User enters `www.cisco.com`
    
2. **Layer 6 – Presentation**: Data formatting/encoding
    
3. **Layer 5 – Session**: Session setup and management
    
4. **Layer 4 – Transport**:
    
    - Uses **UDP** (usually) or **TCP** (if needed)
        
    - DNS typically uses **port 53**
        
5. **Layer 3 – Network**:
    
    - Requires **destination IP address**
        
    - If domain name is used, it must first be **resolved via DNS**
        

That’s where DNS comes in—it provides the IP address so the packet can be built properly at Layer 3.

## 🧠 DNS Use in Enterprises

Most enterprises maintain an **internal DNS server** for resolving names of devices within their organization.

### 🏢 Example:

- Company domain: `flackbox.com`
    
- Internal DNS Server can resolve:
    
    - `engineeringa.flackbox.com` → `172.23.6.10`
        
    - `linuxa.flackbox.com` → `172.23.4.2`
        
- But that DNS server **won’t know public domains** like `www.cisco.com`
    

In such cases, the internal DNS server will **forward the request** to a **public DNS server** (like Google’s `8.8.8.8` or your ISP’s DNS).

## 📡 DNS Traffic Protocols

- **Protocol**: UDP (usually), TCP (if needed)
    
- **Port**: 53 (same for both protocols)
    

DNS queries are **small and fast**, so UDP is used by default. TCP is used only if:

- The query response is too large for UDP
    
- DNS zone transfers between servers (more data-heavy)

## 🖥️ Lab Example: DNS in a Windows Environment

Let’s go through a step-by-step real-world example using Windows and Windows Server DNS:

### 📌 Client Info (via `ipconfig /all`):

- **IP Address**: `172.23.1.10`
    
- **Gateway**: `172.23.1.254`
    
- **DNS Server**: `172.23.4.1`
    
- **DNS Domain**: `FlackboxA.lab`
    

### 📌 DNS Server (Windows Server):

- **Authoritative for**: `FlackboxA.lab`
    
- Example entries:
    
    - `EngineeringA` → `172.23.6.10`
        
    - `LinuxA` → `172.23.4.2`
        

#### 🧭 Forwarding External Queries:

- DNS Server can’t store **all** domains on the Internet
    
- To resolve external names (e.g., `www.google.com`), it uses **forwarders**
    
- Forwarder IPs are manually configured (but not shown in this example)
    

---

### 🧪 Testing DNS Locally

#### `nslookup linuxa`

- Queries DNS server (`172.23.4.1`)
    
- Resolves: `linuxa.flackboxa.lab` → `172.23.4.2`
    

#### `ping linuxa`

- Works because the FQDN was successfully resolved
    

📌 You can now reach `linuxa` via:

- Hostname: `linuxa`
    
- FQDN: `linuxa.flackboxa.lab`
    
- IP: `172.23.4.2`

## 🧩 Summary – What DNS Does

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|**Translates FQDN to IP**|Turns `www.cisco.com` into `198.133.219.25` (for example)|
|**Runs at Layer 7**|But essential for completing packet creation at Layer 3|
|**Uses UDP port 53**|TCP used only when needed|
|**Supports internal/external resolution**|Internal DNS for local names, forwarders for Internet|
|**Essential for most applications**|Web, email, VoIP all rely on DNS to find servers|
