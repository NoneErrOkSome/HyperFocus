Absolutely! Here's **Part 3** explained casually and clearly — just the official names where needed, and everything else in plain language:

# 🧪 Part 3: DNS in Action – Windows Client & Server Lab

---

## 🖥️ The Setup: What We're Working With

In this lab, you’ve got:

- A **Windows DNS Server**
    
- A **Windows Client** (just a normal PC in the network)
    

They’re both on the same internal network. The DNS server is there to help the client find devices by name — instead of typing IP addresses.

---

## 🛠️ What Happens Step-by-Step

### 🧑‍💻 Step 1: Client Sends a DNS Request

Let’s say the user on the client types this into a browser or does a ping:

```
ping engineeeringa.flackboxa.lab
```

The client doesn’t know the IP for that name, so it asks:

> “Hey DNS server, do you know the IP for `engineeeringa.flackboxa.lab`?”

This is called a **DNS query**.

---

### 📨 Step 2: DNS Server Gets the Query

The DNS server checks its records to see if it knows that name.

If it **does know**, it replies:

> “Yep! That’s `172.23.6.10`.”

If it **doesn’t know**, it might:

- Forward the request (if it’s a public site)
    
- Or reply with an error if the name doesn’t exist
    

---

### 🧾 Step 3: DNS Server Responds

The client gets the answer — the IP — and uses it to talk to the other computer or open the website.

Now the client **remembers** that answer for a while (this is called **caching**), so it doesn’t have to ask again right away.

---

### 💡 Step 4: You Can See It Happen

On the DNS Server, you can go into the **DNS Manager** tool and look at the zones:

- There’s a zone for `flackboxa.lab`
    
- Inside are **A records** like:  
    `engineeringa → 172.23.6.10`  
    `linuxa → 172.23.4.2`
    

You can even **add, edit, or delete** records manually.

---

## 🧪 Test Commands You Can Use

On the client, try these:

```bash
ping engineeringa.flackboxa.lab
```

Checks if the name resolves and you can reach the IP.

```bash
nslookup engineeringa.flackboxa.lab
```

Asks the DNS server directly: “What’s the IP for this name?”

```bash
ipconfig /displaydns
```

Shows what names the client already remembers (cached).

---

## 🧼 Want to Clear the Cache?

If you want to test fresh lookups, clear the client’s DNS memory with:

```bash
ipconfig /flushdns
```

This makes the system forget what it knows so far.

---

## 🧠 Final Idea: Why This Matters

In real life, this setup is everywhere — offices, schools, data centers. Internal DNS makes things easier:

- You can use **friendly names** instead of IPs
    
- It's easier to manage networks
    
- Changes to device IPs don’t break stuff — just update the DNS record

## ✅ Quick Summary

|What Happened|Plain Explanation|
|---|---|
|Client asked DNS|“What's the IP for this name?”|
|DNS replied|“Here’s the IP!”|
|Client used it|Now it can connect to the other machine|
|You can test it|Using `ping`, `nslookup`, or `ipconfig`|
|It’s all managed|Inside the DNS Manager on the server|
