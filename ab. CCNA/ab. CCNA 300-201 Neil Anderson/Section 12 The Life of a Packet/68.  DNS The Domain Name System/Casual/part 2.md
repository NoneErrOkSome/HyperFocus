# 🧠 Part 2: How DNS Works Inside a Company (Enterprise Style)

---

## 🏢 Internal DNS — What’s Going On?

In a business, DNS isn’t just for the internet — it’s also used **inside the company** to help computers talk to each other.

Instead of relying on Google DNS or Cloudflare, companies usually have their **own DNS servers** to handle stuff like:

- `engineeringa.flackboxa.lab`
    
- `linuxa.flackboxa.lab`
    

These are **internal names** used only inside the company. The internal DNS server **knows all about them** and responds with their local IP addresses.

---

## 🧭 Why Not Just Use Public DNS?

Because:

- Public DNS servers **don’t know** your internal devices
    
- They can’t resolve names like `printer01.office.local`
    
- Exposing internal DNS info to the public could be a **security risk**
    

So, internal devices use the **company's DNS server**, which stores a **custom domain zone** like `flackboxa.lab`.

That DNS server is called **authoritative** — it owns the info for that internal domain.

---

## 🌐 What About the Internet?

Internal DNS doesn’t know everything about the internet. So, when someone tries to access a **public site** like `www.cisco.com`, the DNS server needs help.

This is where **DNS forwarding** comes in.

---

## 🔁 What Is DNS Forwarding?

When the company DNS doesn’t have an answer, it forwards the request to a **public DNS**, like:

- Google DNS → `8.8.8.8`
    
- Cloudflare DNS → `1.1.1.1`
    

The public server replies with the IP, and the internal DNS passes it back to your device. It also **remembers** (caches) the answer to speed things up next time.

---

### 🔐 Bonus: DNS Forwarding = Control

Using internal DNS with forwarders gives the company more control:

- They can **monitor** which sites are being looked up
    
- **Block** suspicious or unwanted sites
    
- **Log** DNS activity for auditing or troubleshooting

## 📡 Example From the Lab

|Setting|Value|
|---|---|
|Client IP|`172.23.1.10`|
|Gateway|`172.23.1.254`|
|DNS Server|`172.23.4.1`|
|Internal Domain|`flackboxa.lab`|

That DNS server handles all internal names. For outside lookups, it forwards to `8.8.8.8` or `1.1.1.1`.

This setup is managed in the **Forwarders tab** of the DNS Server configuration.

## ✅ Quick Recap

|Term|What It Means|
|---|---|
|**Internal DNS**|Handles name lookups inside the company|
|**Authoritative Zone**|The private domain the DNS server manages (e.g., `flackboxa.lab`)|
|**Public DNS**|Used to look up external domains (like `google.com`)|
|**Forwarding**|Sending unknown requests from internal DNS to a public one|
|**Why It’s Good**|Central control, better security, faster lookups with caching|
