Here’s **Part 1: Overview of the Packet Journey and OSI Stack Review**, fully explained in my own words based on the lecture:

# 🧩 Part 1: Overview of the Packet Journey and OSI Stack Review

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Lecture

This lecture is a **milestone**. It ties together everything you’ve learned so far—ARP, DNS, MAC addresses, IP routing, encapsulation, and the OSI model—into a complete, real-world scenario.

You’ll now follow the **life of a packet** from the moment a user types a website name into a browser to the point where it reaches the correct web server across **multiple subnets** and **routers**.

---

## 🌐 Scenario Summary

|Element|Value|
|---|---|
|Client|Host A (`10.10.10.10`)|
|Goal|Reach `www.flackbox.com`|
|DNS Server|`10.10.100.10`|
|Routers Involved|Router A|
|Website IP (resolved later)|`10.10.12.10`|

✅ The key point: **Host A doesn’t know the destination IP yet**, so it needs DNS to find it.  
But DNS lives in another **subnet**, so the request must be **routed**.

## 📦 OSI Stack Refresher – Packet Composition

This part reuses the OSI model to explain **how a packet is built**, from top to bottom:

### 🔁 Top-to-Bottom Encapsulation:

|OSI Layer|What Happens|
|---|---|
|**Layer 7 – Application**|User opens browser, types `www.flackbox.com`|
|**Layer 6 – Presentation**|Data formatting (e.g., HTML, encryption if HTTPS)|
|**Layer 5 – Session**|Manages connection session setup (especially with TCP later)|
|**Layer 4 – Transport**|Chooses TCP, destination port = 80 (HTTP)|
|**Layer 3 – Network**|Needs to add source and destination IP addresses|
|**Layer 2 – Data-Link**|Needs to add source and destination MAC addresses|
|**Layer 1 – Physical**|Sends bits as electrical/wireless signals|

---

### 🧠 Problem at Layer 3

When Host A gets to **Layer 3**, it wants to create the packet, but doesn’t yet know the **IP address of the website**.  
It only knows the **FQDN**: `www.flackbox.com`.

This is where **DNS** is required.

---

## 🔍 Why This Matters

This lecture demonstrates:

- **Encapsulation in action**
    
- How **ARP and DNS** work **together**
    
- How **routers assist with subnet communication**
    
- The real-world relationship between **MAC addresses** (local) and **IP addresses** (global)
    

It mimics a **real corporate network** with:

- Multiple **subnets**
    
- DNS in a different network
    
- Multiple **switches and routers**
    
- DNS resolution before **HTTP traffic**

## ✅ Summary

|Concept|Meaning|
|---|---|
|Goal|Send a web request from Host A to a web server|
|First Step|Resolve the FQDN to an IP address using DNS|
|Why DNS needs routing|DNS server is in a different IP subnet|
|Why ARP is needed first|Host A must find its **default gateway’s MAC address**|
|OSI Stack Reminder|Packet is built from top (Layer 7) to bottom (Layer 1)|
