To fully explain **Part 1** of this packet flow lecture—involving DNS resolution across multiple subnets and routers—I would break it into **five parts** due to the layered complexity and multiple steps involved:

---

### 🧩 **Part 1: Overview of the Packet Journey and OSI Stack Review**

- Introduction to the scenario
    
- Why this lecture ties everything together
    
- Review of how a packet is composed using the OSI model
    

---

### 🌐 **Part 2: Host A Initiates DNS Query – ARP for Default Gateway**

- Host A wants to reach `www.flackbox.com`
    
- Determines it must send a DNS query
    
- Uses ARP to resolve the MAC address of its default gateway (Router A)
    
- Switch behavior and ARP cache updates
    

---

### 🛰️ **Part 3: DNS Query Routed to DNS Server**

- Host A sends DNS request to 10.10.100.10 (DNS Server)
    
- Routed through Router A
    
- Router A performs ARP for DNS Server
    
- Switch 3 behavior and ARP cache updates
    
- DNS query forwarded to DNS Server
    

---

### 🧠 **Part 4: DNS Server Processes Request and Replies**

- DNS Server receives the request
    
- DNS lookup for `www.flackbox.com` → 10.10.12.10
    
- DNS Server responds to Host A via Router A
    
- Uses ARP cache entries to avoid unnecessary ARP requests
    

---

### 🔁 **Part 5: Final DNS Response Returns to Host A**

- Router A routes DNS reply back to Host A
    
- Switches handle unicast forwarding
    
- Host A receives the IP address of `www.flackbox.com`
    
- Host A now knows to send HTTP traffic to 10.10.12.10 via Router A
