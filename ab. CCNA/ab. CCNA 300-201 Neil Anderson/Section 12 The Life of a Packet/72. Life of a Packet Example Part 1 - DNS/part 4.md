Awesome! Here's **Part 4: DNS Server Processes Request and Replies**, clearly explained in my own words based on the lecture:

# 🧠 Part 4: DNS Server Processes Request and Replies

Now that the DNS request from **Host A** has reached the **DNS Server**, it's time to see how the server handles the request, looks up the IP address, and sends a response **back to the original client** through the router.

---

## 🔹 Step 1: DNS Server Receives the Request

The DNS Server at `10.10.100.10` receives the incoming unicast packet.

Let’s break down how the **DNS Server processes it using the OSI model**, this time from **bottom to top** (reverse of how it was built):

### ⬆️ OSI Model Processing (Bottom-Up):

|Layer|What DNS Server Checks|
|---|---|
|**Layer 1**|Physical wire → signal is received|
|**Layer 2**|Sees **destination MAC** = its own (`3333.4444.5555`) → continue processing|
|**Layer 3**|Sees **destination IP** = its own (`10.10.100.10`) → keep going|
|**Layer 4**|Sees **protocol** is UDP, **port** is 53 → this is a DNS request|
|**Layer 5–7**|Parses the DNS Application Layer and checks the requested name|

✅ The packet is confirmed to be **intended for this server** and is passed up the stack for DNS processing.

## 🔹 Step 2: DNS Server Looks Up the Requested FQDN

- DNS query is:  
    **“What is the IP address for `www.flackbox.com`?”**
    
- The server checks its internal DNS database and finds:
    
    ```
    www.flackbox.com → 10.10.12.10
    ```
    
- Now it prepares a **DNS response** containing this IP address.

## 🔹 Step 3: DNS Server Sends DNS Reply to Host A

### 🧭 Routing Decision:

- DNS Server sees the **destination IP** of the reply is `10.10.10.10`
    
- That’s in a **different subnet**
    
- So the reply must go through the **default gateway**, which is Router A at `10.10.100.1`
    

📌 The DNS Server **already has Router A’s MAC address** from earlier ARP exchange, so **no ARP request is needed**

### ✉️ DNS Response Packet:

|Layer|Value|
|---|---|
|Source IP|`10.10.100.10` (DNS Server)|
|Dest IP|`10.10.10.10` (Host A)|
|Source MAC|`3333.4444.5555` (DNS Server)|
|Dest MAC|`8888.9999.AAAA` (Router A – default gateway)|
|Layer 4|UDP response, port 53|
|Payload|"`www.flackbox.com` is at `10.10.12.10`"|

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Switch 3 Forwards the Reply to Router A

- Switch 3 sees that MAC `8888.9999.AAAA` belongs to Router A
    
- It sends the reply to **Port 1**
    

---

## 🔹 Step 5: Router A Forwards DNS Reply to Host A

### 🧭 Router A’s Routing Table:

- Sees destination IP: `10.10.10.10`
    
- It has an interface on that subnet → forward out that interface
    
- Already knows Host A’s MAC from earlier → no ARP needed
    

### 📨 Forwarded Packet:

|Layer|Value|
|---|---|
|Source IP|`10.10.100.10` (DNS Server)|
|Dest IP|`10.10.10.10` (Host A)|
|Source MAC|`4444.5555.6666` (Router A interface to Host A)|
|Dest MAC|`1111.2222.3333` (Host A)|

📌 IP stays **unchanged**, MAC addresses **change per hop**.

---

## 🔹 Step 6: Switch 1 Forwards to Host A

- MAC `1111.2222.3333` is known → Port 1
    
- Switch sends the DNS response to Host A
    

---

## 🔹 Step 7: Host A Receives the DNS Reply

- Host A checks:
    
    - Destination MAC: ✅ it's mine
        
    - Destination IP: ✅ it's mine
        
    - Port 53 (UDP): ✅ it’s a DNS response
        
- Host A reads the DNS answer:
    
    ```
    www.flackbox.com → 10.10.12.10
    ```
    
- Host A now **knows the IP address** of the web server it wants to talk to.

## ✅ Summary – DNS Resolution Flow Complete

|Device|What It Did|
|---|---|
|DNS Server|Processed DNS query, resolved FQDN to IP, sent reply via router|
|Router A|Routed reply back to Host A|
|Switches|Forwarded frames based on MAC address tables|
|Host A|Received and understood DNS response: `www.flackbox.com → 10.10.12.10`|

---

Host A now has everything it needs to send the **actual HTTP traffic** to `10.10.12.10`.
