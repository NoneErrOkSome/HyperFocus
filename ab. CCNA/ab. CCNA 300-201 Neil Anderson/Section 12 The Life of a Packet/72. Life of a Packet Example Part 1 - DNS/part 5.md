# 🔁 Part 5: Final DNS Response Returns to Host A

This final part completes the DNS flow: **Host A now receives the answer to its DNS query** — the IP address of the web server `www.flackbox.com`, which is `10.10.12.10`. With this, it’s ready to build and send its HTTP request in the next lecture.

## 🧭 Quick Recap of the Flow So Far

1. Host A wanted to visit `www.flackbox.com`
    
2. It didn’t know the IP, so it initiated a **DNS query**
    
3. The query was routed to the **DNS server** at `10.10.100.10` via Router A
    
4. DNS server looked up the name and found:
    
    ```
    www.flackbox.com → 10.10.12.10
    ```
    
5. It replied with this IP back to Host A
    
6. Host A now has the resolved IP and is ready to send web traffic

## 🧪 Final Review of the DNS Response Packet

Here’s what the DNS response looked like as it traveled back to Host A:

|Header Layer|Source|Destination|
|---|---|---|
|MAC Address|3333.4444.5555 (DNS Server)|8888.9999.AAAA (Router A)|
|IP Address|10.10.100.10 (DNS Server)|10.10.10.10 (Host A)|
|Layer 4|UDP, Source Port: 53 (DNS)|Destination Port: 1024+ (random)|
|Payload|DNS answer: `www.flackbox.com → 10.10.12.10`||

## 🔄 MAC Address Handoff Across Hops

|Link|Source MAC|Destination MAC|
|---|---|---|
|DNS Server → Router|3333.4444.5555|8888.9999.AAAA|
|Router → Host A|4444.5555.6666|1111.2222.3333|

✅ Notice: the **MAC addresses change hop-by-hop**, but the **IP addresses stay the same end-to-end**.

## 📥 Host A Processes the Reply

1. The packet arrives at Host A
    
2. Host A confirms:
    
    - Destination MAC: ✅ matches its NIC
        
    - Destination IP: ✅ its own
        
    - UDP port 53: ✅ this is a DNS response
        
3. Host A reads the DNS record:
    
    ```
    www.flackbox.com → 10.10.12.10
    ```
    
4. Host A stores the result in its **local DNS cache**
    
    - Now it doesn’t need to query DNS again for this name (at least for a while)

## 🧠 What Happens Next?

Host A is now **ready to send an HTTP request** to `10.10.12.10`, the IP address of the web server.

But wait — it doesn’t yet know the **MAC address** of that IP!

So in the next lecture, you’ll see how Host A performs **another ARP** — this time for the web server — and then sends its **HTTP traffic** using **TCP port 80**.

## ✅ Summary – DNS Journey Complete

|Task|Status|
|---|---|
|FQDN known?|✅ `www.flackbox.com`|
|DNS IP resolved?|✅ `10.10.12.10`|
|MAC for DNS Server learned?|✅ `3333.4444.5555`|
|ARP for gateway used?|✅ `4444.5555.6666`|
|MAC for web server known?|❌ Not yet (will happen next)|
|Host A ready for HTTP?|✅ Yes — it can now build the packet|
