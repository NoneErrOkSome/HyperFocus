Absolutely! Here's **Part 3: DNS Query Routed to DNS Server**, clearly and deeply explained based on the lecture:

# 🛰️ Part 3: DNS Query Routed to DNS Server

Now that Host A has resolved its **default gateway’s MAC address** using ARP, it’s ready to **send the DNS request**. Since the DNS server (`10.10.100.10`) is in a **different subnet**, the packet must be routed through **Router A**.

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Host A Sends the DNS Request

Host A now builds a unicast packet for the DNS query.

### 🔐 DNS Request Frame (from Host A to Router A):

|Header Type|Source|Destination|
|---|---|---|
|MAC Header (Layer 2)|`1111.2222.3333` (Host A)|`4444.5555.6666` (Router A)|
|IP Header (Layer 3)|`10.10.10.10` (Host A)|`10.10.100.10` (DNS Server)|
|Transport (Layer 4)|Protocol: UDP, Port 53||
|Payload|DNS request for `www.flackbox.com`||

The MAC destination is the **router**, not the final destination.

📌 Host A has no idea what the DNS server's MAC address is — only that it’s reachable **through the gateway**.

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Switch 1 Forwards the DNS Request

- **Switch 1** receives the packet
    
- It knows Router A’s MAC → **Port 2**
    
- It forwards the unicast frame directly to **Router A**
    

---

## 🔹 Step 3: Router A Routes the DNS Request

Router A receives the packet:

### 👓 What it sees:

- Destination **IP**: `10.10.100.10`
    
- It has an interface in `10.10.100.0/24` → ✅ Routing is possible
    
- But it does **not yet know the MAC address** of the DNS Server
    

So Router A needs to perform **another ARP request**.

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Router A Sends an ARP Request for DNS Server

### ARP Request Details:

|Field|Value|
|---|---|
|Sender IP|`10.10.100.1` (Router A’s interface)|
|Sender MAC|`8888.9999.AAAA`|
|Target IP|`10.10.100.10` (DNS Server)|
|Target MAC|`FFFF.FFFF.FFFF` (Broadcast)|

Router A sends the ARP broadcast out its **10.10.100.1** interface.

---

## 🔹 Step 5: Switch 3 Handles the ARP Request

- **Switch 3** receives the ARP request
    
- Adds Router A’s MAC → **Port 1**
    
- **Floods** the ARP request out **Port 2**, which connects to the DNS Server
    

---

## 🔹 Step 6: DNS Server Replies to ARP

The DNS Server (10.10.100.10):

- Recognizes the ARP request is for **itself**
    
- Sends an **ARP reply** back to Router A
    

### ARP Reply Details:

|Field|Value|
|---|---|
|Source IP|`10.10.100.10`|
|Source MAC|`3333.4444.5555`|
|Destination MAC|`8888.9999.AAAA`|

📌 The DNS Server also adds **Router A’s IP/MAC mapping** to its ARP cache.

---

## 🔹 Step 7: Switch 3 Forwards the ARP Reply

- It’s a **unicast reply**
    
- Switch 3 already knows where to find Router A → Port 1
    
- Forwards the ARP reply only to Router A
    

---

## 🔹 Step 8: Router A Updates ARP Cache and Forwards DNS Request

- Router A now knows the DNS Server’s MAC
    
- Forwards the original DNS request to `10.10.100.10`
    

### Updated MAC Header:

|Header Type|Source|Destination|
|---|---|---|
|MAC Header (Layer 2)|`8888.9999.AAAA` (Router A)|`3333.4444.5555` (DNS Server)|
|IP Header (Layer 3)|`10.10.10.10` (Host A)|`10.10.100.10` (DNS Server)|

📌 Notice:

- **IP header stays the same** (Host A ↔ DNS Server)
    
- **MAC header changes** per hop (Router A ↔ DNS Server)
    

---

## ✅ Summary – What Just Happened

|Step|Action|
|---|---|
|Host A sent DNS query|MAC destination = Router A|
|Router received packet|Saw it needed to forward to 10.10.100.10|
|Router didn’t know MAC|Sent ARP request for DNS Server|
|DNS Server replied|Gave MAC address (3333.4444.5555)|
|Router forwarded packet|Changed Layer 2 headers, kept Layer 3 IPs unchanged|

---

Host A’s DNS query has now reached the DNS server.  
In the next part, we’ll cover how the **DNS Server processes the request and returns the response**.
