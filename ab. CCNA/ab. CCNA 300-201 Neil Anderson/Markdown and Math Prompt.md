To get answers consistently in **pure raw LaTeX** format (with `$$ ... $$` for block math), you can **request it explicitly** using phrases like:

1. **"Provide the answer in pure raw LaTeX, using `$$ ... $$` for block math."**
2. **"Give me the explanation in LaTeX format, without rendering, only the raw LaTeX code."**
3. **"Format all mathematical expressions using `$$ ... $$` for block math, and provide the text as raw LaTeX code."**
4. **"I need the response in LaTeX format exactly as written, without rendering."**
5. **"Use `$$ ... $$` for all mathematical expressions, and provide the full response in raw LaTeX code."**

Additionally, if you prefer **entirely LaTeX formatted documents** (like `.tex` files), you can also say:

- **"Format this as a `.tex` file using proper LaTeX syntax, including document class, sections, and equations."**
- **"Give me a full LaTeX document starting from `\documentclass{article}` and including all math expressions using `$$ ... $$`."**

By using these instructions, I'll always provide responses **in pure raw LaTeX** without rendering. ðŸš€
