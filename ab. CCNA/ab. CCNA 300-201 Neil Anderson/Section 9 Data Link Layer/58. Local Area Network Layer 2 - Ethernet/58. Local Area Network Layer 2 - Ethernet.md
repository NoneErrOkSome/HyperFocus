Here’s a detailed breakdown of **Layer 2 – The Data-Link Layer** based on your lecture:

---

## 🧠 Overview of Layer 2 – Data-Link Layer

Layer 2 of the **OSI Reference Model** is responsible for the reliable transmission of data frames between two devices on the **same local network**. It sits just above the **Physical Layer (Layer 1)** and below the **Network Layer (Layer 3)**.

---

## 🧱 Layer 2 Responsibilities

### 🔄 Frame Handling

- At Layer 2, data is organized into **frames**.
- These frames are **encoded into bits** that can be transmitted on the physical medium.
- It handles **frame synchronization**, meaning it helps sender and receiver align the bits properly.

### ❗ Error Detection & Correction

- Layer 2 can detect and sometimes correct errors that may occur at Layer 1.
- This capability depends on the protocol in use (e.g., **Ethernet** includes a Frame Check Sequence for error checking).

---

## 🌐 Common Layer 2 Protocols

### 📎 Ethernet

- Most common protocol used in **Local Area Networks (LANs)**.
- Operates using **MAC addresses**.

### 📡 Others

- **PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)** – often used in WANs.
- **Frame Relay** – legacy WAN protocol.
- **FDDI** – used in older high-speed networks.

## 📦 PDU (Protocol Data Unit) Naming by Layer

|OSI Layer|Name of PDU|
|---|---|
|Layer 7 to 5|Data|
|Layer 4 (Transport)|Segment|
|Layer 3 (Network)|Packet|
|**Layer 2 (Data-Link)**|**Frame**|
|Layer 1 (Physical)|Bits|

- It’s **one encapsulated unit** that changes names depending on which OSI layer is examining it.
- So, at Layer 2, it's called a **frame** even though it contains segments and packets inside it.

## 🧱 Ethernet Frame Structure

### 1. **Preamble**

- Syncs timing between sender and receiver.

### 2. **MAC Addresses**

- **Source MAC Address** (device that sends)
- **Destination MAC Address** (device that receives)

### 3. **Ethertype**

- Identifies the **protocol inside** the frame (e.g., IPv4).

### 4. **Data**

- The encapsulated upper-layer info (usually from Layer 3).

### 5. **FCS (Frame Check Sequence)**

- A **CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)** for error checking.

---

## 🏷️ MAC Address (Media Access Control)

### 🔢 Structure

- A **48-bit hexadecimal** address.
- Written as 6 octets: `68:50:43:24:58:01`

### 📊 Breakdown

- **First 24 bits (OUI):** Vendor/Manufacturer (e.g., Cisco, IBM)
- **Last 24 bits:** Unique ID set by vendor

### 🧩 Properties

- Globally unique (2⁴⁸ possible addresses).
- **Flat addressing** – no hierarchy, unlike IP addresses.
- Used **only in the local network segment**, not routable beyond.

## 💻 How to Find Your MAC Address

### 🪟 Windows

```bash
ipconfig /all
```

- Look for **Physical Address** under the correct network adapter.

### 🐧 Linux

```bash
ifconfig
```

- Look for **HWaddr** under the Ethernet interface.

### 🔧 Cisco Devices

```bash
show interface
```

- Look for `Hardware is ... , address is ...`
- The **BIA (Burned-In Address)** is the default MAC, though it can be overridden in software.
