To **cover all the details** from **Day 5 Part 1** of the Jeremy‚Äôs IT Lab "Ethernet LAN Switching" video, we can break the content down into **7 clear topics**. Here's a casual and simple breakdown of each topic with the essential concept it covers:

---

## üß† **1. Ethernet LAN Overview**

- What is a LAN?
    
- Switches **do not** separate LANs, **routers** do.
    
- LANs can span multiple switches as long as they‚Äôre not split by a router.
    
- We're only focusing on **traffic within a LAN** in this lesson.

## üß± **2. OSI Model Review**

- Layer 1 (Physical): Cables, voltage, bits as signals.
    
- Layer 2 (Data Link): MAC addressing, formatting frames.
    
- Switches operate at Layer 2.
    
- Ethernet touches both Layer 1 and 2.

## üì¶ **3. Ethernet Frame Structure**

- **Header Fields**:
    
    - **Preamble** (7 bytes) ‚Üí Sync clocks using `10101010`
        
    - **SFD** (1 byte) ‚Üí Marks start of actual frame `10101011`
        
    - **Destination MAC** (6 bytes)
        
    - **Source MAC** (6 bytes)
        
    - **Type/Length** (2 bytes) ‚Üí 0x0800 = IPv4, 0x86DD = IPv6
        
- **Trailer**:
    
    - **FCS** (4 bytes) ‚Üí Used for error detection via CRC
        
- **Total (without preamble/SFD)**:  
    6+6+2+4=18¬†bytes6 + 6 + 2 + 4 = 18\ \text{bytes}  
    (If you include preamble/SFD, total = 26 bytes)

## üßæ **4. MAC Addresses**

- **48-bit physical address** (6 bytes)
    
- Assigned during manufacturing (a.k.a. **BIA ‚Äì Burned-In Address**)
    
- Format: `AAAA.AA00.0001` (12 hexadecimal digits)
    
- First 3 bytes: **OUI** (vendor), Last 3: device-specific

## üîç **5. MAC Address Learning in Switches**

- Switch looks at **source MAC** of incoming frame.
    
- It builds a **MAC Address Table** mapping MAC ‚Üî Interface.
    
- **Dynamically learned**, not preconfigured.
    
- MAC entries age out after 5 minutes of inactivity.

## üåä **6. Frame Forwarding Logic**

- **Known Unicast**: Forward frame out the specific port.
    
- **Unknown Unicast**: Flood out all ports (except incoming one).
    
- **Broadcast**: Flood out all ports.
    
- **Unicast** = sent to one host
    
- **Broadcast** = sent to all hosts (e.g., ARP)
    
- **Flooding** = only happens if switch doesn‚Äôt know where to send it.
    

---

## üß™ **7. Ethernet Frame Processing Example**

- PC1 sends a unicast frame to PC2.
    
- Switch learns PC1's MAC (source) and floods because PC2‚Äôs MAC is unknown.
    
- PC2 receives, PC3 drops.
    
- When PC2 replies, the switch learns PC2's MAC and sends directly to PC1 (no flood).
    
- Process repeats with multiple switches.
