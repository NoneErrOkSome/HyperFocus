# 🧾 Part 4: MAC Address Breakdown

**(Media Access Control Address – MAC Address)**

---

## 🤖 What is a MAC Address?

The **MAC address** stands for **Media Access Control address**. It’s a **unique identifier** assigned to a **network interface card (NIC)** at the **hardware level**.

📌 It’s like the **fingerprint** of your network device—it’s burned into it from the factory.

### ✳️ Format:

- **48 bits** long (which equals **6 bytes**)
    
- Written in **hexadecimal** (base-16)
    
- Looks like this:  
    `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`  
    or `AABB.CCDD.EEFF`  
    or `AA-BB-CC-DD-EE-FF`

## 🔥 Burned-In Address (BIA)

The MAC address is often called a **BIA – Burned-In Address**, because it’s **permanently programmed** into the hardware by the manufacturer.

🧠 Important: Although it’s burned in, many devices allow you to **override** the MAC address via software, but that’s more of an exception than the rule.

## 🧩 MAC Address Structure: 2 Halves

A MAC address has two halves:

|Half|Size|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|**OUI – Organizationally Unique Identifier**|3 bytes (24 bits)|Identifies the manufacturer|
|**Device ID – Unique Identifier per device**|3 bytes (24 bits)|Identifies the specific device|

### Example MAC Address:

```
E8-BA-70-11-28-74
```

|Part|Value|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|OUI|`E8-BA-70`|Belongs to the manufacturer (like Cisco or Intel)|
|Device ID|`11-28-74`|Unique for that specific network card|

So, if you see two PCs with the same **OUI**, they’re likely from the **same vendor**.

---

## 🧮 Why 48 Bits and Not 32 or 64?

- 48 bits gives **281 trillion** possible combinations. That’s enough for billions of devices worldwide to each have a unique MAC.
    
- It was chosen as a balance between uniqueness and frame size efficiency.

## 💡 MAC Addresses vs IP Addresses

|Feature|MAC Address|IP Address|
|---|---|---|
|Layer|Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)|Layer 3 (Network Layer)|
|Assignment|Burned-in (hardware)|Configured (software)|
|Length|48 bits|32 bits (IPv4), 128 bits (IPv6)|
|Uniqueness|Globally Unique|Can be reused in different networks|
|Used by|Switches|Routers|

A **MAC address stays the same** no matter what network you connect to.  
An **IP address can change** depending on where you are.

## 🧪 MAC Address and Hexadecimal Refresher

- MAC addresses are written in **hexadecimal** (base-16), because it's more compact for 48 bits.
    
- Each **hex digit = 4 bits**  
    So:  
    `12 hex digits × 4 bits = 48 bits`
    

### Hex digits:

`0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F`  
(A = 10, B = 11, ..., F = 15)

💬 Example:  
`AA:BB:CC` in binary =  
`10101010 10111011 11001100`

## 🧠 Summary Table

|Term|Full Form|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|MAC Address|Media Access Control Address|Unique hardware address of a network device|
|BIA|Burned-In Address|Factory-assigned MAC address|
|OUI|Organizationally Unique Identifier|First 3 bytes that identify the vendor|
|NIC|Network Interface Card|Hardware that connects a device to a network|
|CRC|Cyclic Redundancy Check|Error-detection method in the trailer|

## 🛠️ Real-World Use

When a **switch receives a frame**, it reads the **source MAC address** and uses it to:

1. **Learn where that device is (which port it came from)**
    
2. **Add it to the MAC address table**
    

Then it checks the **destination MAC** to figure out whether to:

- **Forward** (if known)
    
- **Flood** (if unknown)
    
- **Drop** (if error in FCS)
    

That entire process revolves around these MAC addresses.
