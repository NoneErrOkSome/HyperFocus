# üß† Full Summary: Day 5 Part 1 ‚Äì Ethernet LAN Switching

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **LAN Basics & Layer Context**

- A **LAN (Local Area Network)** is a network in a small area like a home or office.
    
- **Routers separate LANs**, while **switches extend LANs**.
    
- This lesson focuses only on **communication within a LAN** (intra-LAN traffic).
    
- Switches operate at **Layer 2 ‚Äì Data Link Layer** of the **OSI model**.
    
- Ethernet operates at **both Layer 1 and Layer 2**.
    

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **OSI Model Focus ‚Äì Layer 1 & Layer 2**

### üì¶ Layer 1: **Physical Layer**

- Handles **physical media** and **signal transmission** (cables, connectors, bits).
    
- Example: UTP cables, RJ45, light pulses (fiber), or radio signals (Wi-Fi).
    

### üîó Layer 2: **Data Link Layer**

- Adds MAC addressing and frame structure.
    
- Responsible for **node-to-node delivery**.
    
- Ethernet frames are created and processed here.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Ethernet Frame Structure**

An **Ethernet frame** is how data is carried across a LAN.

|Field|Size|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|**Preamble**|7 bytes|Sync clocks (`10101010`)|
|**SFD (Start Frame Delimiter)**|1 byte|Marks start of frame (`10101011`)|
|**Destination MAC**|6 bytes|Who it‚Äôs for|
|**Source MAC**|6 bytes|Who it‚Äôs from|
|**Type/Length**|2 bytes|Type (e.g. `0x0800` = IPv4) or length|
|**Payload**|46‚Äì1500 bytes|Actual data|
|**FCS (Frame Check Sequence)**|4 bytes|Error detection via **CRC**|

üß† Total fixed frame size = **18 bytes header + trailer** (plus 8 bytes of preamble/SFD if counted).

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ **MAC Addresses (Media Access Control)**

- **MAC Address** = 48-bit (6-byte) hardware address.
    
- Assigned by manufacturer = **BIA (Burned-In Address)**.
    
- Written in **hexadecimal** (e.g., `E8BA.7011.2874`).
    
- Split into two parts:
    
    - **OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier)** ‚Äì first 3 bytes ‚Üí identifies vendor.
        
    - **Device Identifier** ‚Äì last 3 bytes ‚Üí identifies device.
        

üí° MAC addresses are **globally unique**, unlike IP addresses.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Switching Logic ‚Äì Learning & Forwarding**

- Switches **build a MAC address table dynamically** by inspecting **source MAC addresses** of incoming frames.
    
- MAC Table = `MAC Address ‚Üí Interface`
    
- If **destination MAC is known** ‚Üí forward directly.
    
- If **destination MAC is unknown** ‚Üí **flood the frame** out all other ports.
    

### Frame Types & Switch Behavior:

|Type|Description|Switch Action|
|---|---|---|
|**Known Unicast**|Destination MAC in table|Forward to correct port|
|**Unknown Unicast**|Not in table|Flood|
|**Broadcast**|`FFFF.FFFF.FFFF`|Flood|
|**CRC Error**|FCS check fails|Drop silently|

- Entries **expire after 5 minutes of inactivity** = **MAC aging**.
    

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Multi-Switch Environment**

When multiple switches are involved:

- Each switch builds its **own MAC table**, independently.
    
- Learning still happens from **source MACs only**.
    
- Flooding works the same ‚Äî unknown destinations trigger flooding across connected switches.
    
- Uplink ports between switches behave just like any other port in terms of learning and forwarding.
    

### Key Insight:

Switches don‚Äôt care how many hops away a device is‚Äîonly **which port** leads to it.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Ethernet Frame Lifecycle & Wrap-Up**

**From frame creation to delivery:**

1. Frame is built at source (with MAC addresses + payload + FCS).
    
2. Sent to switch via cable (Layer 1).
    
3. Switch reads:
    
    - **Source MAC** ‚Üí updates MAC table
        
    - **Destination MAC** ‚Üí decides to forward or flood
        
4. Frame reaches destination, is processed.
    
5. If a reply is sent, same process happens in reverse.
    
6. After a few exchanges, switches know exactly where each MAC is.
