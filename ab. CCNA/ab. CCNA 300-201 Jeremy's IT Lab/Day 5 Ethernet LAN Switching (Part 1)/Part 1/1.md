Absolutely! Here's a **full deep-dive explanation** of **Day 5 Part 1 – Ethernet LAN Switching**, broken down into casual and clear sections for easy understanding—no quiz, just pure explanation.

# 💡 What’s Going On in Day 5?

This lesson is your **first deep dive into Layer 2 networking**, specifically **Ethernet switching**. We shift from just cables and plugs to how devices actually talk to each other across switches. It focuses entirely on **LANs**—local area networks—and how Ethernet frames move around _inside_ them.

## 🏠 What Is a LAN?

**LAN = Local Area Network**  
Think of a LAN as your home Wi-Fi or your office’s network. It’s just a network that’s _local_—a bunch of devices that are relatively close to each other and connected without going through the public Internet.

- A **router** separates LANs.
    
- **Switches** just extend a LAN. You can keep adding switches and still be in the same LAN.
    
- If two PCs connect to the same router interface (or to switches that eventually connect to the same router interface), they’re in the same LAN.
    

**Example Setup:**

- 3 PCs → connected to a switch → connected to a router → Internet  
    We only care about **the part before the Internet** in this lesson. That’s the LAN.

## 🧱 OSI Model Refresher: Layer 1 vs Layer 2

### Layer 1 – Physical Layer

- Deals with _signals_ and _wires_.
    
- Think: voltage levels, fiber light pulses, radio waves.
    
- Ethernet cables, RJ45 connectors, fiber cables all fall here.
    
- This is where **bits** become **signals**.
    

### Layer 2 – Data Link Layer

- Deals with _frames_, _MAC addresses_, and _how devices talk directly_.
    
- It’s responsible for **point-to-point delivery**: PC to switch, switch to router, etc.
    
- If Layer 3 is "How do I get to Google?", Layer 2 is "How do I get to the next step in the path?"
    

**Switches live here.** They don’t care about IP addresses, only **MAC addresses**.

## 📦 The Ethernet Frame: What Gets Sent?

Think of an Ethernet frame like a _shipping box_ with:

- A label (who it’s going to and from)
    
- Some tape (integrity check)
    
- The actual package (your data)
    

Let’s break it down.

### 📬 Header Fields (from left to right):

1. **Preamble (7 bytes)**
    
    - A series of `10101010` bits, repeated.
        
    - Its job: synchronize clocks so the receiver knows “Hey, data is coming!”
        
2. **SFD – Start Frame Delimiter (1 byte)**
    
    - Pattern is `10101011`, just like preamble but ends in 1.
        
    - Marks the start of the real frame.
        
3. **Destination MAC Address (6 bytes)**
    
    - Where the frame is going (like the "To:" label on a letter).
        
    - If it's `FFFF.FFFF.FFFF`, that means **broadcast to everyone**.
        
4. **Source MAC Address (6 bytes)**
    
    - Where the frame is from (the "From:" label).
        
5. **Type/Length Field (2 bytes)**
    
    - If the value is over `1536`, it means "Type" — most often:
        
        - `0x0800` = IPv4
            
        - `0x86DD` = IPv6
            
    - If it's less than `1500`, it means "Length" — how long the data is.
        

### 📎 Trailer Field:

6. **FCS – Frame Check Sequence (4 bytes)**
    
    - Like the "tape" on your box, it checks for errors in transit.
        
    - Uses a method called CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check).
        
    - If corrupted, the frame is just dropped.
        

### Total (not counting preamble + SFD):

- **18 bytes total for header + trailer**
    
- Preamble and SFD = extra 8 bytes, but usually not counted in the frame's “official” size.

## 🧠 MAC Address: What It Is and Why It Matters

- **MAC = Media Access Control**
    
- 6 bytes (48 bits), globally unique.
    
- Assigned to the NIC (Network Interface Card) when it's manufactured.
    
- Format: `AAAA.AA00.0001` or `AA:AA:AA:00:00:01`
    

### 🔥 Burned-In Address (BIA)

- Called that because it’s physically programmed at the factory.
    

### 📛 MAC Address Breakdown

- First 3 bytes = **OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier)** → identifies the manufacturer.
    
- Last 3 bytes = **Device ID** → unique per device from that vendor.

## 🧮 Quick Side Note: What Is Hexadecimal?

- Instead of just 0–9 like decimal, hex goes 0–9 and **A–F**.
    
- So:
    
    - `A` = 10
        
    - `F` = 15
        
    - `10` (hex) = 16 (decimal)
        
    - `1A` = (1×16 + 10) = 26
        

We use hexadecimal to represent MAC addresses because it’s easier to write and read 48 bits that way.

## 🔄 What Does a Switch Do With Frames?

Switches are **Layer 2 devices**, so they:

1. Look at the **Source MAC** of every frame they receive.
    
2. **Learn**: “Oh, I got this frame from MAC address X on port Y.”
    
    - Adds that to the **MAC Address Table**.
        
3. Look at the **Destination MAC**:
    
    - If it **knows** the port → send directly (known unicast).
        
    - If it **doesn’t know** → flood it out all ports except where it came from (unknown unicast).
        
    - If the MAC is broadcast (`FFFF.FFFF.FFFF`) → flood to all ports (broadcast frame).

## 🧪 Let’s Walk Through a Real Example

Three PCs: PC1, PC2, PC3 → all plugged into switch SW1.

### 🟢 Step 1: PC1 sends a frame to PC2

- Destination MAC: PC2
    
- Source MAC: PC1
    

### 🟡 Step 2: Switch receives it

- SW1 sees source MAC (PC1) → learns that PC1 is on port F0/1.
    
- It **doesn’t know** PC2 yet → floods the frame to all ports except F0/1.
    

### 🔵 Step 3:

- PC2 gets the frame → checks destination MAC → it's me → processes it.
    
- PC3 gets the frame → destination MAC isn’t mine → ignores it.
    

### 🔁 Step 4: PC2 replies

- Destination: PC1
    
- Source: PC2
    

SW1:

- Learns PC2 is on F0/2.
    
- Already knows PC1 is on F0/1 → sends frame directly.
    

✨ Switch now has both MACs learned! All future communication goes directly. No more flooding.

## 🗑️ Aging and Dynamic Entries

- MAC entries aren’t permanent.
    
- If a device is quiet for **5 minutes**, it’s removed from the MAC table.
    
- When it talks again, it’s re-learned.
