Alright, let’s dive into **🌀 Part 5: MAC Learning and Forwarding Behavior** — this is where we see how a **switch thinks** and behaves when it gets an Ethernet frame.

We’ll keep it **casual in tone**, but still explain everything **clearly and thoroughly with full terms and shortforms**.

# 🌀 Part 5: MAC Learning and Forwarding Behavior

**(How switches learn and make decisions)**

---

## 🧠 What’s the goal of a switch?

A switch’s job is to **efficiently forward frames** to the correct destination inside a **Local Area Network (LAN)**.

To do this, it uses something called a **MAC Address Table**, sometimes also called a **CAM Table (Content Addressable Memory Table)**.

This table maps:

```
MAC Address → Interface (Port)
```

### So the switch can think like this:

_"If I get a frame for MAC `AAAA.AA00.0002`, I know that’s on **port F0/2**. I’ll send it there directly."_

But how does it learn which MAC is on which port?

---

## 🧠 MAC Learning = Dynamic Process

Switches **dynamically learn** MAC addresses by looking at the **source MAC address** of every frame they receive.

### 🧪 Real Example:

- PC1 has MAC: `AAAA.AA00.0001`
    
- It sends a frame to PC2 (whose MAC is `AAAA.AA00.0002`)
    
- That frame arrives at Switch SW1 via port F0/1.
    

🧠 The switch sees:

> “This frame came in on **F0/1**, and the **source MAC** is `AAAA.AA00.0001`.”

So, it **adds this to its MAC Address Table**:

```
AAAA.AA00.0001 → F0/1
```

🔁 This is called **Dynamic MAC Learning**.

---

## 🔍 What about the destination MAC?

Once the switch learns the **source MAC**, it then checks the **destination MAC** in the same frame.

There are 2 possibilities:

---

### ✅ 1. **Known Unicast**

> Destination MAC **is in the table**  
> → The switch sends the frame out only that specific port.

This is called **Forwarding**.

---

### ⚠️ 2. **Unknown Unicast**

> Destination MAC **is NOT in the table**  
> → The switch doesn’t know where to send it…

### So what does it do?

It **floods** the frame out **all ports** except the one it came in on.

📌 This is called **Flooding**.

💡 Just to be clear:

- This is not broadcasting to everyone intentionally.
    
- It’s just saying:  
    _“I don’t know where this MAC is yet, so I’ll send it out everywhere in case someone answers.”_

## 📦 Types of Frames (in switch behavior)

|Type of Frame|Description|Switch Action|
|---|---|---|
|**Known Unicast**|Destination MAC is in the table|Forward to that port|
|**Unknown Unicast**|Destination MAC is unknown|Flood to all ports (except incoming)|
|**Broadcast**|Destination is `FFFF.FFFF.FFFF`|Flood to all ports|
|**Multicast**|Special reserved MAC ranges|May flood if IGMP snooping not enabled|

## 🔄 MAC Table Aging

MAC address entries **do not stay forever**.

On Cisco switches (and most others), entries **age out** after:

- **5 minutes of inactivity**
    

This means:

- If a device doesn’t send anything for 5 minutes, the switch will remove it from the table.
    
- The next time it sends something, it’ll get re-learned.
    

🧠 Why age them out?

- Saves memory
    
- Prevents stale or incorrect mappings

## 🚦 Step-by-Step Behavior of a Switch

Let’s walk through it with a full flow:

### Scenario:

- PC1 wants to send data to PC2.
    
- Both are connected to Switch SW1.
    
- Neither MAC is in the table yet.
    

---

### Step 1: PC1 sends a frame

- Source MAC: `AAAA.AA00.0001`
    
- Destination MAC: `AAAA.AA00.0002`
    

---

### Step 2: SW1 receives it on F0/1

- SW1 sees source MAC and adds:
    
    ```
    AAAA.AA00.0001 → F0/1
    ```
    

---

### Step 3: SW1 checks the destination MAC

- `AAAA.AA00.0002` is NOT in the table  
    → So SW1 floods the frame to all other ports (F0/2, F0/3…)
    

---

### Step 4: PC2 receives the frame

- It recognizes its MAC and processes it.
    
- PC3 sees it but drops it (not its MAC).
    

---

### Step 5: PC2 replies to PC1

- Source MAC: `AAAA.AA00.0002`
    
- Destination MAC: `AAAA.AA00.0001`
    

---

### Step 6: SW1 receives the reply

- Learns:
    
    ```
    AAAA.AA00.0002 → F0/2
    ```
    
- Destination MAC is already known  
    → Sends it directly to PC1 on F0/1.
    

✅ No more flooding needed after this — communication is now direct and efficient.

---

## 💡 Reminder: Switches Always Learn from **Source MAC**, Never Destination

The switch **never updates its MAC table** based on the **destination MAC address**. It only learns **where devices are based on who sent the frame**.

---

## 🧠 Key Terms Recap

|Term|Full Form|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|MAC Table|MAC Address Table|Stores MAC → Port mappings|
|CAM Table|Content Addressable Memory Table|Another name for MAC table|
|BIA|Burned-In Address|Default hardware MAC|
|Flooding|—|Sending a frame out all ports except incoming|
|Unicast|—|Frame intended for one device|
|Broadcast|—|Frame sent to all devices (`FFFF.FFFF.FFFF`)|
|Multicast|—|Frame sent to a specific group of devices|
