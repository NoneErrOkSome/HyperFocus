Awesome! Let’s keep the flow going with **🧭 Part 6: Multi-Switch MAC Learning & Frame Forwarding**. This part explains how things work **when you have more than one switch** in a network.

As always, you’ll get the **casual clarity**, with **full technical terms and shortforms** where needed.

# 🧭 Part 6: Multi-Switch MAC Learning & Frame Forwarding

---

## 🏗️ What’s New Here?

So far, we’ve only looked at a **single switch** in the LAN.  
Now we’re adding **multiple switches**—like in a real-world office network.

That means:

- Frames may need to **travel between switches**
    
- Each switch has to **build its own MAC address table**
    
- And, they **learn separately** by watching what frames they receive

## 🧪 Sample Network Layout

```
PC1  ── SW1 ── SW2 ── PC3
PC2 /
```

- PC1 → connected to **SW1**, port F0/1
    
- PC2 → connected to **SW1**, port F0/2
    
- SW1 → connected to **SW2**, port F0/3 on both sides
    
- PC3 → connected to **SW2**, port F0/1
    
- PC4 → connected to **SW2**, port F0/2
    

All devices have **unique MAC addresses**.

## 🔄 Step-by-Step Frame Flow Example

Let’s say:

- PC1 wants to send data to **PC3**
    
- PC1’s MAC: `AAAA.AA00.0001`
    
- PC3’s MAC: `AAAA.AA00.0003`
    

---

### 🧩 Step 1: Frame is sent

- **Source MAC**: `AAAA.AA00.0001`
    
- **Destination MAC**: `AAAA.AA00.0003`
    
- Frame is sent from PC1 → SW1 (F0/1)
    

---

### 🧩 Step 2: SW1 learns from the **source MAC**

SW1 receives the frame:

- Sees source = `AAAA.AA00.0001`
    
- Learns:
    
    ```
    AAAA.AA00.0001 → F0/1
    ```
    

---

### 🧩 Step 3: SW1 checks the **destination MAC**

- Destination `AAAA.AA00.0003` is **not yet in its table**  
    → This is an **unknown unicast frame**
    

🧠 So what does it do?  
**Floods** the frame out all other ports _except F0/1_ (where it came from):

- F0/2 → PC2 (drops it, wrong MAC)
    
- F0/3 → to SW2
    

---

### 🧩 Step 4: SW2 receives the flooded frame

- Frame arrives on **SW2’s F0/3**
    
- Source MAC: `AAAA.AA00.0001`
    
- Destination MAC: `AAAA.AA00.0003`
    

SW2 learns:

```
AAAA.AA00.0001 → F0/3
```

💡 Even though PC1 isn’t _directly_ connected to SW2,  
SW2 learns:  
_"To reach MAC `AAAA.AA00.0001`, send frames out F0/3"_.

---

### 🧩 Step 5: SW2 checks destination MAC

- Destination MAC `AAAA.AA00.0003` is **unknown** → So SW2 **floods** the frame out:
    
- F0/1 → PC3 (correct match)
    
- F0/2 → PC4 (drops the frame)
    
- Not out F0/3 (that’s the incoming port)
    

---

### 🧩 Step 6: PC3 receives the frame

- It checks the destination MAC
    
- It's a match → Processes the frame normally
    

---

### 🧩 Step 7: PC3 replies to PC1

Now PC3 sends a reply frame:

- Source MAC: `AAAA.AA00.0003`
    
- Destination MAC: `AAAA.AA00.0001`
    

---

### 🧩 Step 8: SW2 learns from **PC3**

- PC3’s frame enters SW2 at port F0/1
    
- SW2 learns:
    
    ```
    AAAA.AA00.0003 → F0/1
    ```
    

Then it checks the **destination MAC**:

- `AAAA.AA00.0001` is **already known** → So it sends the frame out F0/3 to SW1
    

---

### 🧩 Step 9: SW1 gets the frame

- Comes in on F0/3
    
- SW1 learns:
    
    ```
    AAAA.AA00.0003 → F0/3
    ```
    

Then it checks the destination:

- `AAAA.AA00.0001` is in its table → F0/1  
    → Forwards frame directly to PC1

## 🧠 Lessons from This Flow

|Concept|What it means|
|---|---|
|**MAC learning happens per switch**|SW1 and SW2 learn separately|
|**Switches learn from source MACs only**|Never from destination|
|**Unknown unicast = flooding**|Until the destination is learned|
|**Entries can point to uplinks**|Switches don’t care how far the MAC is—just _which port_ gets them there|

🧠 Each switch just says:

> “If I ever need to reach that MAC again, I’ll send it through this port.”

---

## 🕐 Timeout Reminder

On both switches:

- If no traffic comes from a MAC address for **5 minutes**
    
- That entry is **removed**
    
- The learning-flooding process happens again next time
    

This timeout is called **MAC address aging**.

## 🧠 Key Term Recap

|Term|Full Form|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|Dynamic MAC Learning|—|Switch learns MACs from incoming frames|
|Unknown Unicast|—|Frame with a destination not in the table|
|Flooding|—|Sending frame to all ports (except incoming)|
|Known Unicast|—|Frame with a destination in the MAC table|
|Uplink|—|Port that connects a switch to another switch or router|
