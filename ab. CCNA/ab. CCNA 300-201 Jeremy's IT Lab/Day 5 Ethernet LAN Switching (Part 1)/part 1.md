| **What is the main focus of Ethernet LAN Switching?**                            | Ethernet LAN Switching focuses on how data moves between switches and the devices connected to them within a local network. It determines how switches forward Ethernet frames based on MAC addresses.           |
| **Which OSI layers are involved in Ethernet?**                                   | Ethernet operates at **Layer 1 (Physical Layer)**, which deals with cables and signals, and **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)**, which handles MAC addresses and switching.                                            |
| **What does Layer 2 (Data Link) provide?**                                       | Layer 2 ensures direct data transfer between two devices (like a PC and a switch) and uses **MAC addresses** to identify devices on the network. It also detects and corrects some physical transmission errors. |
| **What is a Local Area Network (LAN)?**                                          | A LAN is a network that connects devices within a **limited area**, such as an office, home, or small building, allowing them to communicate efficiently.                                                        |
| **What device connects separate LANs?**                                          | A **router** connects different LANs, enabling communication between them by using IP addresses.                                                                                                                 |
| **What is encapsulation in networking?**                                         | Encapsulation is the process of adding headers and trailers to data as it moves through the network layers. This helps in proper transmission and interpretation of data across different devices.               |
| **What is the Layer 2 Protocol Data Unit (PDU) called?**                         | The **PDU** at Layer 2 is called a **Frame**, which contains MAC addresses and other essential information for data transmission.                                                                                |
| **What is the first field in an Ethernet frame?**                                | The **Preamble**, which consists of alternating 1s and 0s, helps the receiving device synchronize with the sender before reading the data.                                                                       |
| **What is the purpose of the preamble?**                                         | The preamble allows the receiver to **synchronize its clock** with the incoming signal so it can properly interpret the data in the frame.                                                                       |
| **What is the second field in an Ethernet frame?**                               | The **Start Frame Delimiter (SFD)**, which marks the end of the preamble and indicates the start of the actual Ethernet frame.                                                                                   |
| **What does the SFD do?**                                                        | The SFD tells the receiving device that the actual Ethernet frame is about to begin, ensuring that the frame is read correctly.                                                                                  |
| **What address is used in Layer 2 to identify devices?**                         | Layer 2 uses **MAC (Media Access Control) addresses**, which are unique identifiers assigned to network devices.                                                                                                 |
| **How long is a MAC address?**                                                   | A MAC address is **48 bits** long, typically written as **6 bytes** (e.g., AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF).                                                                                                                   |
| **What is the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI)?**                        | The **OUI** is the **first 3 bytes** of a MAC address, assigned to a manufacturer (e.g., Cisco, Dell, HP). It helps identify the device vendor.                                                                  |
| **What field in an Ethernet frame specifies the Layer 3 protocol?**              | The **Type** field in the Ethernet frame indicates whether the frame is carrying **IPv4, IPv6, or another protocol**.                                                                                            |
| **What is the role of the Frame Check Sequence (FCS)?**                          | The **FCS** detects transmission errors by using a **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)**, ensuring data integrity.                                                                                                   |
| **How does a switch learn MAC addresses?**                                       | A switch learns MAC addresses by examining the **Source MAC Address** in incoming frames and storing it in its MAC address table.                                                                                |
| **What is an Unknown Unicast Frame?**                                            | A frame whose **destination MAC address is not in the switch’s MAC table**. The switch does not know where to send it.                                                                                           |
| **What does a switch do with an unknown unicast frame?**                         | The switch **floods** the frame out of **all ports** (except the one it was received on) until it learns the correct destination.                                                                                |
| **What is a Known Unicast Frame?**                                               | A frame whose **destination MAC address is already in the switch’s MAC table**, allowing the switch to forward it directly.                                                                                      |
| **How long does a Cisco switch store dynamically learned MAC addresses?**        | **5 minutes** (300 seconds) of inactivity. If no traffic is received from that MAC address within this period, it is removed from the MAC table.                                                                 |
| **What is the difference between a Unicast, Broadcast, and Multicast frame?**    | - **Unicast**: Sent to **one specific device**. - **Broadcast**: Sent to **all devices** in the network. - **Multicast**: Sent to **a group of devices**, not all.                                               |
| **What type of addressing does Ethernet use?**                                   | **MAC addressing** at **Layer 2**. Unlike IP addresses (Layer 3), MAC addresses are permanent and unique to each device.                                                                                         |
| **What happens when a switch receives a frame with a known destination MAC?**    | The switch **forwards** the frame only to the correct port associated with that MAC address.                                                                                                                     |
| **What happens when a switch receives a frame with an unknown destination MAC?** | The switch **floods** the frame to all ports except the one it received it from, hoping to learn the correct destination.                                                                                        |
| **What format is a MAC address written in?**                                     | **Hexadecimal format** (12 characters), usually written as **AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF** or **AA.BB.CC.DD.EE.FF**.                                                                                                       |
| **What is the function of the Type/Length field in an Ethernet frame?**          | It indicates either: - The **protocol** in use (IPv4, IPv6, etc.) - The **length of the encapsulated data** (for some Ethernet versions).                                                                        |
| **What is the purpose of the CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)?**                    | CRC is a mathematical algorithm used to **detect errors** in the received frame. If errors are found, the frame is discarded.                                                                                    |
| **What happens when a switch learns a MAC address?**                             | It **stores** the MAC address and the corresponding **port** in its **MAC address table**, helping it forward future frames efficiently.                                                                         |
| **What happens if a switch's MAC address table is full?**                        | The switch will **start flooding unknown frames** out of all ports, which can slow down the network.                                                                                                             |
