### **Ethernet LAN Switching (Part 2) - Conceptual Breakdown**

This lesson builds on **Ethernet LAN Switching (Part 1)** by going deeper into key concepts such as **Ethernet frame structure**, **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**, and **MAC address table management**. The focus remains on communication within a **Local Area Network (LAN)**.

## **1. Revisiting Ethernet Frames & Minimum Frame Size**

Before discussing LAN switching, itâ€™s important to revisit the **Ethernet frame structure** and its key components.

### **Ethernet Frame Structure Recap**

|Field|Size|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Preamble**|7 bytes|Synchronizes receiver clock (not part of Ethernet header)|
|**Start Frame Delimiter (SFD)**|1 byte|Marks the start of the frame|
|**Destination MAC**|6 bytes|Identifies the recipient|
|**Source MAC**|6 bytes|Identifies the sender|
|**Type/Length**|2 bytes|Specifies either the type of protocol (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) or the payload length|
|**Payload**|**46 - 1500 bytes**|Encapsulated network layer packet|
|**Frame Check Sequence (FCS)**|4 bytes|Error detection using CRC|

### **Minimum Ethernet Frame Size**

- The **minimum size for an Ethernet frame is 64 bytes**.
- Since the **header + trailer** take up **18 bytes**, the minimum **payload size must be 46 bytes**.
- If the payload is **less than 46 bytes**, **padding bytes (zeros)** are **added** to meet the minimum requirement.
- Example: A **34-byte** payload will receive **12 padding bytes**.

### **Why is there a Minimum Frame Size?**

- Ensures that frames are **long enough** to be detected on the network.
- Prevents **collision detection issues** in **half-duplex Ethernet**.

## **2. LAN Network Setup & MAC Addressing**

To illustrate Ethernet LAN switching, letâ€™s examine a simple **LAN network topology** with **four PCs and two switches**.

- Each PC has a **unique MAC address**.
- All PCs share the **same manufacturerâ€™s OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier)**, but their **device-specific MAC address segments are different**.
- **IP addresses** are also assigned, even though switches use **MAC addresses** for forwarding.

|Device|MAC Address (Last 4 Digits)|IP Address|
|---|---|---|
|**PC1**|`9D00`|`192.168.1.1`|
|**PC2**|`6200`|`192.168.1.2`|
|**PC3**|`3900`|`192.168.1.3`|
|**PC4**|`0A00`|`192.168.1.4`|

## **3. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) - Resolving MAC Addresses**

When a device sends data, it **uses an IP address**, but the actual communication in an Ethernet LAN occurs **via MAC addresses**. If the sender **does not know** the recipientâ€™s MAC address, it uses **ARP**.

### **ARP Process**

1. **PC1 wants to communicate with PC3** but doesnâ€™t know PC3â€™s MAC address.
2. **PC1 sends an ARP Request**, which is a **broadcast frame** (`FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`).
3. **All devices receive the broadcast**, but only PC3 **responds**.
4. **PC3 replies with its MAC address**, sending an **ARP Reply** (a **unicast frame** directly to PC1).
5. **PC1 updates its ARP table** and stores PC3â€™s MAC address for future communication.

|**ARP Message**|**Type**|**MAC Address Used**|
|---|---|---|
|**ARP Request**|Broadcast|`FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF` (all devices)|
|**ARP Reply**|Unicast|Sent only to the requesting device|

### **Viewing the ARP Table**

- On **Windows/Linux/macOS**: `arp -a`
- On **Cisco devices**: `show arp`

Example Output of `arp -a`:

```
Internet Address      Physical Address      Type
192.168.1.3          0C2F.B06A.3900        Dynamic
```

- **Dynamic**: Learned via ARP request.
- **Static**: Manually configured.

## **4. How Switches Handle Ethernet Frames**

Once a switch receives an Ethernet frame, it decides how to forward it based on **MAC address learning**.

### **Step 1: Learning MAC Addresses**

1. A frame arrives at a switch.
2. The switch **extracts the source MAC address** and **records it in the MAC address table**, mapping it to the incoming port.
3. If the **destination MAC address is already known**, the switch forwards the frame **only to the correct port**.

### **Step 2: Frame Forwarding Methods**

|**Frame Type**|**Forwarding Method**|
|---|---|
|**Known Unicast**|Sent directly to the specific port.|
|**Unknown Unicast**|**Flooded** to all ports (except source).|
|**Broadcast**|Sent to **all devices** in the LAN.|

### **Step 3: Aging & Clearing MAC Addresses**

- **Dynamic MAC addresses expire after 5 minutes** of inactivity.
- To manually clear MAC addresses:
    - **Clear all MAC addresses:** `clear mac address-table dynamic`
    - **Clear a specific MAC address:** `clear mac address-table dynamic address 0C2F.B011.9D00`
    - **Clear MAC addresses for a specific interface:** `clear mac address-table dynamic interface gi0/0`

## **5. Ping & ICMP: Testing Network Connectivity**

Once **ARP resolves the MAC address**, devices can send **actual data**. A common way to test network connectivity is using **ping**.

### **Ping Process**

1. **PC1 sends a ping (`ping 192.168.1.3`)** to PC3.
2. The ping message consists of:
    - **ICMP Echo Request** (sent by the sender).
    - **ICMP Echo Reply** (response from the recipient).
3. The response time is recorded, indicating **network latency**.

### **Interpreting Ping Results**

- **Success (`!!!!!`)** â†’ All echo requests were replied to.
- **Partial success (`....!`)** â†’ Some packets were lost.
- **Failure (`.....`)** â†’ No response received.

## **6. Capturing & Analyzing Network Traffic (Wireshark)**

To visualize network traffic, tools like **Wireshark** capture packets for analysis.

### **Example Wireshark Analysis**

- **ARP Request:**
    
    ```
    Who has 192.168.1.3? Tell 192.168.1.1
    ```
    
- **ARP Reply:**
    
    ```
    192.168.1.3 is at 0C2F.B06A.3900
    ```
    
- **ICMP Echo Request:**
    - **Source:** `192.168.1.1`
    - **Destination:** `192.168.1.3`
- **ICMP Echo Reply:**
    - **Source:** `192.168.1.3`
    - **Destination:** `192.168.1.1`
