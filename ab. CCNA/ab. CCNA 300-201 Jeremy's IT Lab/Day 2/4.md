Here’s **Part 4** of **“Interfaces and Cables – Day 2”**, and now we’re diving into how **speed** works in networking. Why is everything measured in **bits** and not **bytes**? Let’s break it down casually and clearly.

## ⚡ Part 4: Let’s Talk Speed (Bits vs Bytes)

Alright, so when someone says, “This is a gigabit connection,” or “I have 100 Mbps internet,” what does that actually mean?

Let’s start from the ground up.

---

### 🧮 What Is a Bit?

A **bit** is the smallest unit of data in networking. It can be either:

- `0` (off)
    
- `1` (on)
    

That’s it. Every single piece of data—text, images, video, whatever—is made of a bunch of **bits**.

Now, if you group **8 bits** together, you get **1 byte**.

So:

- **8 bits = 1 byte**
    

This is super important because **computers often talk in bytes**, but **networks talk in bits**.

---

### 📏 Why Are Speeds Measured in Bits?

When data is sent over a cable, it goes **bit by bit**—one at a time. The cable literally sends electrical pulses (or light, if it’s fiber) to represent 1s and 0s.

So when we say:

- **100 Mbps** = 100 **megabits per second**
    

We’re talking about the **raw speed** at which the cable can move bits down the line.

We don’t measure in bytes here because the network doesn’t send full bytes at once—it sends them **bit by bit**.

### 📚 A Quick Chart

Let’s put all the common units into perspective:

|Unit|Full Name|Size|
|---|---|---|
|1 Kb|1 kilobit|1,000 bits|
|1 Mb|1 megabit|1,000,000 bits|
|1 Gb|1 gigabit|1,000,000,000 bits|
|1 Tb|1 terabit|1,000,000,000,000 bits|

**Note:** This is the **decimal system**. (Networking uses base 10, not base 2 like computers.)

---

### 🧠 Important Distinction

- If your internet is **100 Mbps**, that’s **megabits**.
    
- But if your file is **100 MB**, that’s **megabytes**.
    

**1 byte = 8 bits**, so:

- **100 Mbps internet ≈ 12.5 megabytes per second (MBps)** download speed
    

Always pay attention to **lowercase ‘b’** (bit) vs **uppercase ‘B’** (byte). It makes a huge difference.

---

### 💡 Bottom Line

- **Networks send data one bit at a time**, so we measure speed in bits per second.
    
- **Bytes are used for storage and file sizes**, like what you see on your hard drive.
    
- To convert bits to bytes, just divide by 8.

In **Part 5**, we’ll go into the actual **Ethernet cable types and standards**—like what “100BASE-T” means and how fast those cables can go. Let’s decode that mess next!
