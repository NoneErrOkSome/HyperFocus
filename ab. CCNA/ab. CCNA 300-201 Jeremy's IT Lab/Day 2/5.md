Here’s **Part 5** of **“Interfaces and Cables – Day 2”**, and now we’re diving into the actual **Ethernet cable standards**—you’ve probably heard things like "Fast Ethernet" or "Gigabit Ethernet" tossed around. Let’s break it down in plain English.

## 🧩 Part 5: Ethernet Standards Over Copper (Twisted Pair)

When we talk about Ethernet cables, we’re usually referring to cables made of **copper wires**—specifically **Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)** cables.

These are the **standard Ethernet cables** with the **RJ-45 connectors** you plug into your laptop or router.

### 📋 Common Ethernet Standards (Over Copper)

Let’s look at the most common types of Ethernet that use copper cables:

|Common Name|IEEE Standard|Informal Name|Max Speed|Max Cable Length|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Ethernet|802.3|10BASE-T|10 Mbps|100 meters|
|Fast Ethernet|802.3u|100BASE-T|100 Mbps|100 meters|
|Gigabit Ethernet|802.3ab|1000BASE-T|1 Gbps|100 meters|
|10 Gigabit Ethernet|802.3an|10GBASE-T|10 Gbps|100 meters|

### 🧠 Decoding the Name

Let’s take **100BASE-T** as an example:

- **100** = 100 megabits per second
    
- **BASE** = baseband transmission (don’t worry too much about this—it just means the signal uses the whole wire, not sharing with other signals)
    
- **T** = twisted pair cabling
    

So if someone says “100BASE-T,” they’re talking about **Fast Ethernet**, which uses twisted pair cables and runs at 100 megabits per second.

### ⚙️ All of These Use UTP (Twisted Pair) Cables

These are the same everyday Ethernet cables you're probably using at home. They’re cheap, flexible, and easy to work with.

All the standards in the table above support a **maximum length of 100 meters**, or about **328 feet**. That’s plenty for most offices and homes.

---

### 🛠️ Speed Compatibility

Here’s something useful to know: **Ethernet standards are backward compatible**. So:

- A Gigabit Ethernet port (1000BASE-T) can still talk to a Fast Ethernet device (100BASE-T)
    
- A 10 Gigabit Ethernet port can step down to work with 1 Gbps or 100 Mbps devices (as long as it's supported)
    

The devices will **auto-negotiate** the highest speed they both support.

---

### ⚡ Summary

- The numbers tell you the speed
    
- "BASE" means baseband signaling
    
- The letter at the end tells you what kind of cable is used—**T** for twisted pair
    
- All of them support up to **100 meters**

In **Part 6**, we’ll dig into what’s actually inside those UTP cables, which wires are used, and how Ethernet pins work. Some standards only use 4 wires out of 8! Ready to see how it all connects?
