Based on the full and rich explanation of **“Interfaces and Cables – Day 2”**, the content naturally breaks down into **10 clear, casual topics** to cover all the important details without skipping anything. Here’s how I’d structure it:

---

## ✅ 10 Topics for "Interfaces and Cables – Day 2"

---

### 1. **Interfaces and RJ-45 Ports**

- What are interfaces?
    
- What does “RJ” mean?
    
- What plugs into what?
    

---

### 2. **What Ethernet Really Is**

- Ethernet as a family of standards
    
- It’s more than just a cable
    

---

### 3. **Networking Standards & Why They Matter**

- Compatibility between cables/devices
    
- Physical vs logical standards
    

---

### 4. **Bits vs Bytes and Network Speeds**

- Why speed is measured in bits per second
    
- Bit vs byte (8 bits = 1 byte)
    
- Kilobit, Megabit, Gigabit, Terabit
    

---

### 5. **Ethernet Standards over Copper (UTP)**

- Table of 10BASE-T to 10GBASE-T
    
- Meaning of 100BASE-T
    

---

### 6. **UTP Cable Structure and Pin Usage**

- What’s inside a UTP cable (twisted pairs)
    
- RJ-45 pin layout
    
- Which standards use how many wires
    

---

### 7. **Pin Numbers and Full-Duplex Communication**

- Which pins transmit vs receive
    
- Switch vs PC behavior
    
- How full-duplex works
    

---

### 8. **Straight-through vs Crossover Cables**

- When to use each type
    
- Pin mapping
    
- Why crossover cables were needed
    

---

### 9. **Auto MDI-X and Gigabit Advancements**

- Auto MDI-X removes the cable guessing
    
- Gigabit/10G uses all pairs, bidirectional
    

---

### 10. **Fiber Optic Cables**

- Light vs electricity
    
- Multimode vs Single-mode
    
- Fiber cable anatomy
    
- SFP modules and standards
    
- UTP vs Fiber comparison
