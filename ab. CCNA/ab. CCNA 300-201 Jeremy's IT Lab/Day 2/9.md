Here’s **Part 9** of **“Interfaces and Cables – Day 2”**, and this one is all about how **Gigabit Ethernet** (and beyond) works differently under the hood. We’re talking **more wires**, **faster speeds**, and a clever way to send data both directions on the **same wire pair**.

## 🚀 Part 9: Gigabit and 10 Gigabit Ethernet – What’s Different?

You might be thinking, “Okay, Fast Ethernet (100 Mbps) uses 4 wires—what about Gigabit and 10 Gigabit?” The short answer: **they use all 8 wires**, and they do it **in both directions at once**.

Let’s unpack that.

### ⚙️ How Fast Ethernet Works (100 Mbps)

As a refresher:

- Uses **2 pairs of wires** (4 wires total)
    
- One pair for **transmitting**
    
- One pair for **receiving**
    
- Direction is fixed—1 pair only talks one way
    

So it’s like two one-way roads: one for sending, one for receiving.

---

### 💡 Enter 1000BASE-T (Gigabit Ethernet)

Now, with **1000BASE-T**, things level up:

- Uses **all 4 twisted pairs** (8 wires total)
    
- And here’s the twist: **all 4 pairs are bidirectional**
    
- Meaning: each pair can **transmit and receive at the same time**
    

That’s wild, right?

---

### 🔄 How Does Bidirectional Transmission Work?

To avoid confusion and signal collision, Gigabit Ethernet uses some clever math and circuitry:

- Each device uses **digital signal processing (DSP)** to separate incoming and outgoing signals
    
- This allows simultaneous communication in **both directions** on the same wire
    

It’s like having a conversation with someone where you’re both talking **and** listening at the exact same time—and still understanding each other perfectly.

---

### 🧠 Why Use All 8 Wires?

Using all 8 wires gives:

- **More capacity** to send data
    
- **Reduced load** per wire (each pair handles part of the job)
    
- The ability to maintain **high speeds over standard Cat5e or Cat6 cables**
    

So, if you plug a Gigabit Ethernet cable into your PC, it's not just using a couple of wires—it’s using **everything**, all at once, in both directions.

---

### ⚡ 10GBASE-T (10 Gigabit Ethernet)

Now let’s push it even further.

**10GBASE-T** is 10 times faster than Gigabit Ethernet:

- Also uses **all 4 twisted pairs**
    
- Also uses **bidirectional communication**
    
- Requires **higher-quality cabling** (usually Cat6A or better)
    
- Uses **more advanced signal processing** to handle the crazy-fast speeds
    

Just like Gigabit, it sends and receives **simultaneously** on all wires, but at a much higher data rate.

In **Part 10**, we’ll flip the script and look at **fiber optic cables**—how they use **light instead of electricity**, the difference between **multimode** and **single-mode**, and how they're used in real-world networks.
