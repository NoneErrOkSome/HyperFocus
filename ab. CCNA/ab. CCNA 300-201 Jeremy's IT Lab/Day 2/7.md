Here’s **Part 7** of **“Interfaces and Cables – Day 2”**, and now we’re talking about **pin numbers**, **transmit and receive**, and how **full-duplex communication** works. This is where you really see how switches and PCs communicate without stepping on each other’s toes.

## 🔄 Part 7: Pin Numbers and Full-Duplex Communication

Alright, so we’ve opened up the Ethernet cable and seen that it has **8 wires** and uses an **RJ-45 connector** with **8 pins**. But how are those pins used when devices send and receive data?

Let’s walk through it using **100BASE-TX** (Fast Ethernet) as the example.

### 🧰 PC or Router Pin Usage

When a **PC or router** is sending data over Fast Ethernet (100 Mbps), it uses:

- **Pin 1** → Transmit (Tx+)
    
- **Pin 2** → Transmit (Tx−)
    
- **Pin 3** → Receive (Rx+)
    
- **Pin 6** → Receive (Rx−)
    

So, PCs and routers transmit on **pins 1 and 2**, and receive on **pins 3 and 6**.

### 📥 Switch Pin Usage

Switches are wired the opposite way so communication works correctly. They use:

- **Pin 1 & 2** → Receive (Rx)
    
- **Pin 3 & 6** → Transmit (Tx)
    

This way:

- PC's Tx goes into the switch's Rx
    
- PC's Rx connects to the switch's Tx
    

Everything lines up nicely.

### 🧠 Why Does This Matter?

This opposite wiring means that when a **PC connects to a switch**, you can use a **straight-through cable** (where pin 1 connects to pin 1, pin 2 to pin 2, etc.).

But when you connect **two devices that transmit on the same pins** (like PC-to-PC or switch-to-switch), you’d traditionally need a **crossover cable**—more on that in Part 8.

### 🗣️ Full-Duplex Communication

Now here’s something cool: when devices are connected this way, they can operate in **full-duplex** mode.

**Full-duplex** means both devices can **send and receive data at the same time**, using different pairs of wires. This is way more efficient than **half-duplex**, where only one device talks at a time (like a walkie-talkie).

With full-duplex:

- No collisions happen
    
- Data flows both directions at once
    
- You get the full speed in each direction (e.g., 100 Mbps up and 100 Mbps down)

### 🚧 What Happens If Pins Don’t Match?

If the transmit pins on one device connect to the transmit pins on the other—well, nothing happens. The devices are both talking into each other and no one’s listening.

That’s why the **pin roles must be opposite**, unless the devices support **Auto MDI-X**—which we’ll cover next.

---

In **Part 8**, we’ll break down the difference between **straight-through and crossover cables**, when to use each, and how **Auto MDI-X** changed the game by making those cable types almost irrelevant.
