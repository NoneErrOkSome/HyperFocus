Here’s **Part 6** of **“Interfaces and Cables – Day 2”**, and now we’re getting inside the Ethernet cable to see what’s going on with the **wires**, **pins**, and which ones are actually used depending on the Ethernet speed. Let’s break it down simply.

## 🧵 Part 6: UTP Cable Structure and Pin Usage

So, we’ve talked about **UTP cables** (Unshielded Twisted Pair), but what do they really look like inside?

Let’s pop one open.

---

### 🧬 What’s Inside an Ethernet Cable?

Inside a standard Ethernet cable, there are:

- **4 pairs of wires**
    
- So, **8 wires total**
    
- Each pair is **twisted together**—this helps reduce interference
    

The twisting helps the signals on the wires cancel out electrical noise. That’s why even cheap UTP cables can reliably carry fast signals.

### 🔌 The RJ-45 Connector

The end of an Ethernet cable has an **RJ-45 connector**, which lines up those 8 wires into **8 pins**.

So:

- RJ-45 = 8 pins
    
- Ethernet cable = 8 wires
    
- Each wire connects to a specific pin
    

The pin numbers go from **left to right** when the clip is facing away from you.

### 📶 Which Wires Are Actually Used?

Not all Ethernet standards use all 8 wires. Let’s break it down:

---

#### 📦 10BASE-T (10 Mbps) and 100BASE-TX (100 Mbps)

- These only use **2 pairs** = **4 wires**
    
- **Pins used**: 1, 2, 3, and 6
    

Here’s what each pin does (for a **PC or router**):

- **Pin 1 & 2** → Transmit (Tx)
    
- **Pin 3 & 6** → Receive (Rx)
    

Switches are the opposite—they receive on pins 1 & 2 and transmit on 3 & 6. This makes it work with a regular **straight-through cable**.

---

#### 🚀 1000BASE-T (1 Gbps) and 10GBASE-T (10 Gbps)

- These use **all 4 pairs** = **all 8 wires**
    
- Each pair is **bidirectional**, meaning it can transmit and receive at the same time
    

This is a huge reason why Gigabit and 10 Gigabit Ethernet are so fast.

Also, since all pins are used and each wire is bidirectional, you don’t need to worry about which pins do what anymore—it’s automatic.

---

### 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Ethernet cables always have 8 wires inside
    
- Older standards (10/100 Mbps) use only 4 wires
    
- Newer standards (1 Gbps and up) use all 8 wires
    
- RJ-45 = 8-pin connector
    
- Pin roles depend on the device and the standard being used

In **Part 7**, we’ll look at **how pins are used for sending and receiving**, how full-duplex works, and why it matters whether you’re using a switch or a PC. It’s all about **who transmits where**!
