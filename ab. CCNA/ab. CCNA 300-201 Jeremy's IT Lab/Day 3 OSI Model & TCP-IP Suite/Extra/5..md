### Deep Dive into Layer 3: Network Layer (OSI Model)

#### **Purpose of Layer 3**

The **Network Layer** is responsible for:

1. **Routing**: Determines the best path for data to travel from the source to the destination.
2. **Logical Addressing**: Assigns IP addresses to devices and helps differentiate networks.
3. **Packet Forwarding**: Ensures that data reaches its intended destination, even across multiple networks.
4. **Fragmentation and Reassembly**: Splits large packets into smaller ones to fit network constraints.
5. **Error Handling and Congestion Control**: Helps manage and optimize traffic flow.

### **Core Functions of Layer 3**

#### **1. Logical Addressing (IP Addressing)**

- Layer 3 introduces a universal addressing system, **IP addressing**.
- Each device is assigned an **IP address**, which consists of:
    - **Network ID**: Identifies the network.
    - **Host ID**: Identifies the specific device within the network.

Example:

- **192.168.1.10/24**:
    - **Network ID**: 192.168.1.0
    - **Host ID**: 10
    - **Subnet Mask**: /24 (255.255.255.0) defines that the first three octets represent the network.

#### **2. Routing and Path Selection**

Routers use **routing protocols** and **algorithms** to determine the best path for data to travel.

- **Direct Routing**: If the destination is in the same network, the data is sent directly.
- **Indirect Routing**: If the destination is on another network, the router forwards the data.

##### **Routing Table**

A router maintains a **routing table**, which contains:

- **Destination Network**: Where the packet should go.
- **Next Hop**: The next router or gateway that should handle the packet.
- **Metric**: A value that determines the best path (e.g., hop count, delay).

Example Routing Table:

|Destination|Next Hop|Interface|Metric|
|---|---|---|---|
|192.168.1.0/24|Directly Connected|Gig0/0|1|
|10.10.10.0/24|192.168.1.1|Gig0/1|2|
|172.16.0.0/16|10.10.10.1|Gig0/2|3|

##### **Types of Routing**

1. **Static Routing** – Manually configured routes.
2. **Dynamic Routing** – Uses protocols like OSPF, RIP, and BGP to automatically adjust routes.

#### **3. Packet Forwarding and Encapsulation**

At Layer 3, data is formatted into **packets**. A **packet** consists of:

- **IP Header** (contains source and destination IP addresses)
- **Data Payload** (actual message being transmitted)

Example of an IPv4 Packet Structure:

|Field|Size|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Version|4 bits|Identifies IPv4 (0100)|
|Header Length|4 bits|Specifies the length of the header|
|TTL|8 bits|Decreases with each hop to prevent loops|
|Protocol|8 bits|Defines transport protocol (TCP=6, UDP=17)|
|Source IP|32 bits|The sender’s IP address|
|Destination IP|32 bits|The recipient’s IP address|
|Payload|Variable|Data being transmitted|

#### **Encapsulation Process**

When data moves from Layer 4 to Layer 3, an **IP header** is added. The new unit is called a **packet**.

Example:

1. **Layer 4 (Transport)**: `Data + TCP Header` → Called a **Segment**
2. **Layer 3 (Network)**: `Segment + IP Header` → Called a **Packet**
3. **Layer 2 (Data Link)**: `Packet + MAC Header + FCS` → Called a **Frame**

#### **4. Packet Fragmentation**

- Different network types have **Maximum Transmission Units (MTU)** (e.g., Ethernet: 1500 bytes).
- If a packet is larger than the MTU, Layer 3 **fragments** it into smaller packets.
- At the destination, the fragments are **reassembled**.

Example:

- Original Packet: **3000 bytes**
- MTU: **1500 bytes**
- Fragmentation:
    - Packet 1: **1500 bytes**
    - Packet 2: **1500 bytes**
- Reassembled at the receiver.

#### **5. Error Handling and Congestion Control**

- **TTL (Time-To-Live)**: Prevents packets from looping indefinitely.
- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**: Sends error messages if a packet cannot be delivered.
- **QoS (Quality of Service)**: Prioritizes time-sensitive traffic (e.g., VoIP, video streaming).

### **How Layer 3 Works in a Real Scenario**

#### **Example: PC1 Sends a Packet to PC2 Across Different Networks**

1. **PC1 (192.168.1.10) wants to communicate with PC2 (10.10.10.20).**
2. PC1 checks if the destination is in the same network. Since **10.10.10.20** is not in **192.168.1.0/24**, it forwards the packet to the default gateway (Router).
3. The **router** receives the packet, checks the destination IP, and looks up the best route.
4. The **router forwards** the packet to the next router in the path.
5. The next **router forwards** the packet until it reaches **PC2's network**.
6. The packet arrives at PC2, and **Layer 3 processing ends**.

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Layer 3 provides logical addressing and routing.**
- **Packets are used for data transmission at Layer 3.**
- **Routers operate at Layer 3 and determine the best path for data.**
- **Fragmentation ensures packets fit within network limits.**
- **Error handling mechanisms like TTL and ICMP help maintain network reliability.**
