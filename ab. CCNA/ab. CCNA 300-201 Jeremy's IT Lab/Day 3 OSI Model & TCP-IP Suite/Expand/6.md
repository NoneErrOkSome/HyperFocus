# 🚚 Transport Layer (Layer 4)

## 🧠 What Does Layer 4 Do?

The **Transport Layer** provides **end-to-end** communication between devices.  
It is responsible for:
- **Segmentation and reassembly** of data
- **Reliable** or **unreliable** delivery (depending on protocol)
- Ensuring data gets from one **host** to another **host**

---

## 🔗 Key Functions

1. **Segmentation**  
   Splits large data into smaller **segments**

2. **Reassembly**  
   Reconstructs data at the receiving end

3. **Error detection and recovery**  
   (TCP only)

4. **Flow control & congestion control**  
   (TCP only)

5. **End-to-End delivery**  
   Ensures data goes from **host A** to **host B**, even across many devices

---

## 📦 Segment Structure

Each segment includes a **Layer 4 header**, which contains:
- **Source port**
- **Destination port**
- **Sequence number** (TCP)
- **Acknowledgment number** (TCP)
- **Flags** (e.g., SYN, ACK, FIN)
- **Checksum**

## 🌐 Common Layer 4 Protocols

| Protocol | Type        | Reliability | Use Cases              |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **TCP**  | Connection-oriented | Yes         | Web browsing, Email     |
| **UDP**  | Connectionless     | No          | Streaming, VoIP, Gaming |

---

## 🔁 Transport Layer Flow (Example)

1. Application wants to send a file.
2. Data is segmented:
   - Let's say total data = 12 KB  
   - Each segment = 1.5 KB  
   - So 8 segments created

3. Each segment is tagged with:
   - Sequence number
   - Port numbers

4. Segments passed to Layer 3 (Network Layer)

---

## ✍️ Host-to-Host Delivery

> The Transport Layer establishes a **logical connection** between applications on different hosts.

Even if data passes through routers and switches, it’s **logically** seen as a direct connection.

---

## 📎 Segment Naming Convention

Once the **Layer 4 header** is added, the data becomes a:

$$
\text{Segment} = \text{Layer 4 Header} + \text{Data}
$$

## ⚠️ TCP vs UDP: Key Differences

| Feature             | TCP                         | UDP                       |
|---------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Reliable?           | ✅ Yes                      | ❌ No                     |
| Ordered delivery?   | ✅ Yes (Sequence numbers)     | ❌ No                     |
| Overhead            | Higher (more fields)         | Lower (faster)             |
| Use case            | Email, web, file transfer     | Voice, video, gaming       |

## 🧠 Quick Fact

> **Segments** are what the Transport Layer sends.  
> TCP and UDP are the two most common transport layer protocols.
