# 📡 What is a Networking Model?

## 🧠 Concept Summary

A **networking model** is a **framework that organizes and standardizes** how data is communicated between devices on a network. It helps ensure that hardware and software from different manufacturers can **interoperate**.

## 🧩 Why Networking Models Matter

Imagine if Dell and Apple created their own **private communication protocols** — Dell computers could talk to other Dells, but not to iMacs. This would break the **universal connectivity** we expect today.

**Networking models ensure compatibility**, even across:
- Different countries
- Different vendors
- Different hardware types

## 📜 OSI Model vs TCP/IP Suite

| Feature              | OSI Model                          | TCP/IP Model                       |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Type                 | Conceptual, not used in practice    | Practical, used in real networks    |
| Layers               | 7 layers                            | 4 or 5 layers                       |
| Developed by         | ISO (International Organization for Standardization) | DARPA/DoD (U.S.)        |
| Used for             | Reference and terminology           | Actual implementation               |

## 🛠️ What Is a Protocol?

A **network protocol** is a set of **rules** that govern how devices communicate.

> ⚠️ Protocols are logical rules, **not physical specs** like cable types.

Examples:
- **Ethernet** = Layer 2 protocol
- **IP (Internet Protocol)** = Layer 3 protocol
- **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** = Layer 7 protocol

---

## 📚 Protocols & Networking Models

Visualize a **networking model** like a **bookshelf**, where each shelf holds a category of protocols.

Each layer has specific responsibilities. Example:

- **Layer 3 (Network)**: Defines IP addressing
- **Layer 1 (Physical)**: Might specify electrical voltage or fiber-optic signaling

---

## 💬 Quick Definitions

- **Standard**: An agreed-upon rule or method  
- **Open Standard**: Not owned by any company (e.g., OSI)  
- **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data with layer-specific headers/trailers as it moves **down** the OSI model  
- **De-encapsulation**: Removing those headers/trailers as data moves **up** on the receiving side

---

## 🧪 Notable Points

- The **OSI model** is still used for teaching and discussion.
- The **TCP/IP model** is what your computer and the Internet actually use.
- When engineers say “Layer 4 issue,” they’re **referring to the OSI model**, not TCP/IP.

---

## 🔁 Layer Interaction Types

- **Adjacent-layer interaction**: Layers on the same device communicating (e.g., Layer 4 passing data to Layer 3).
- **Same-layer interaction**: Equivalent layers on different devices communicating (e.g., HTTP ↔ HTTP).

## 📌 Review Questions

1. Why do we need networking models?
2. What is the difference between a protocol and a physical standard?
3. Which model is actually used in real-world networks?
4. What is encapsulation?
