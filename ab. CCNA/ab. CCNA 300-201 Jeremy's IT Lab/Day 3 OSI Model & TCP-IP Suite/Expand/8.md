# 🔌 Data Link Layer (Layer 2)

## 🧠 What Does Layer 2 Do?

The **Data Link Layer** enables **node-to-node communication** over a physical medium.  
It defines how to structure data for reliable delivery over a **single link** (e.g., between a PC and a switch).

---

## 📦 Layer 2 PDU = Frame

When the Network Layer passes a **packet** down to Layer 2, the Data Link Layer:
- Adds a **Layer 2 header**
- Adds a **Layer 2 trailer**

This forms a **frame**:

$$
\text{Frame} = \text{Layer 2 Header} + \text{Packet} + \text{Layer 2 Trailer}
$$

---

## 📇 MAC Addressing

Layer 2 uses **physical addresses** called **MAC (Media Access Control) addresses**.

- Format: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`
- 48-bit (6 bytes)
- Assigned by manufacturer
- Unique per device interface

Used **only within a local network (LAN)**.

## ⚙️ Responsibilities of Layer 2

1. **Framing**  
   Formats packets into frames suitable for transmission

2. **MAC addressing**  
   Adds source and destination MAC addresses

3. **Error detection**  
   Uses **FCS (Frame Check Sequence)** in the trailer

4. **Access control**  
   Controls which device can transmit on a shared medium

5. **Node-to-node delivery**  
   Only between **directly connected** devices

## 🔁 Data Link Header & Trailer

### Header:
- Destination MAC address
- Source MAC address
- Type/Length field

### Trailer:
- **FCS**: Checks for errors using **CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)**

---

## 🔄 Switching & Frame Forwarding

**Switches** operate at Layer 2:

- Read the **destination MAC address** in the frame
- Use the **MAC address table** to decide which port to forward the frame out of
- If unknown → **flood the frame** (send it out all ports except the one it came in on)

## 📡 Types of Frames

| Type              | Description                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Unicast**       | Sent to one device                          |
| **Broadcast**     | Sent to all devices on the LAN (`FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`) |
| **Multicast**     | Sent to a group of devices (e.g., IPv6)     |
| **Unknown Unicast** | Destination unknown → switch floods it     |

## 📌 Layer 2 vs Layer 3

| Layer            | Address Type | Scope        | Devices          |
|------------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| Layer 2 (Data Link) | MAC address  | Local network | Switch           |
| Layer 3 (Network)   | IP address   | Across networks | Router        |

## 🧠 Quick Recap

- Layer 2 **wraps a packet into a frame**
- Adds MAC addresses and error-checking
- Enables **communication within the same LAN**
- **Switches** rely entirely on MAC addresses to forward traffic

## 🧪 Review Questions

1. What is the PDU at Layer 2?
2. What addressing system is used at Layer 2?
3. What does a switch do with an unknown unicast frame?
4. What is the purpose of the FCS trailer?
