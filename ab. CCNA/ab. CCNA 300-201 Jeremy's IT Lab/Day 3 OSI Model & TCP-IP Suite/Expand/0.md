To cover **all the details** from Jeremy’s IT Lab Day 3 video on the OSI Model and TCP/IP Suite, you'd ideally split the content into **10 focused topics**. Each topic covers a major conceptual chunk, so you can digest and review things one bite at a time without info overload.

---

## 🧩 1. **What is a Networking Model?**

- Definition of protocols vs physical standards
    
- Why standardization matters
    
- Conceptual models vs real-world implementations
    
- TCP/IP vs OSI naming
    

---

## 📦 2. **Encapsulation & PDU Types**

- Encapsulation & De-encapsulation
    
- Data flow through OSI layers
    
- Segment, Packet, Frame, Bits
    
- PDU naming at each layer
    

---

## 🧍‍♂️ 3. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**

- Interaction with user applications
    
- Examples: HTTP, HTTPS
    
- Same-layer interaction
    
- Identifying communication partners & sync
    

---

## 🪄 4. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**

- Translation between app & network formats
    
- Encryption/Decryption
    
- File format compatibility (e.g., JPEG vs TXT)
    

---

## 🎙️ 5. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**

- Establish/manage/end communication sessions
    
- Multiple sessions (e.g., YouTube tabs)
    
- Not often used by network engineers — more for app devs
    

---

## 🛤️ 6. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**

- Segmentation & reassembly
    
- End-to-end communication
    
- TCP vs UDP (covered in later lessons)
    
- "Segment" and process-to-process communication
    

---

## 🌍 7. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**

- Logical addressing (IP addresses)
    
- Path selection (routing)
    
- Routers operate here
    
- "Packet" and host-to-host connectivity
    

---

## 🔌 8. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**

- MAC addresses and switches
    
- Frame formatting
    
- Error detection with FCS
    
- Direct node-to-node transfer
    
- Layer 2 trailer (and header)
    

---

## 🔧 9. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**

- Voltage levels, connectors, media types
    
- Conversion to electrical/wireless signals
    
- Bits on the wire
    
- Cables, pins, distances
    

---

## 🔁 10. **OSI vs TCP/IP Model**

- 7-layer OSI vs 4/5-layer TCP/IP
    
- TCP/IP real-world use
    
- OSI terminology still dominates discussions
    
- Layer comparisons & mapping between the models
