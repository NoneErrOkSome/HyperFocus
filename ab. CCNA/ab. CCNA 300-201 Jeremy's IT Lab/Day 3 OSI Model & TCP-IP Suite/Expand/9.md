# ⚙️ Physical Layer (Layer 1)

## 🧠 What Does Layer 1 Do?

The **Physical Layer** is responsible for the **physical transmission of bits** over a communication medium.

It defines:
- Electrical/optical/wireless signaling
- Hardware components (cables, connectors, pins)
- Bit-level encoding and modulation

---

## 💡 Layer 1 Is All About "How"

Unlike higher layers which are about **"what" to send**, Layer 1 is about **how to send it physically**.

Examples:
- Converting 1s and 0s into voltage levels
- Using light pulses over fiber
- Using radio waves for Wi-Fi

---

## 🔢 Layer 1 PDU = Bit

At this layer, everything is reduced to **bits**:

$$
\text{Bit} \in \{0, 1\}
$$

- These bits are the actual signals sent on the medium.
- There is no header or trailer at Layer 1 — just raw transmission.

## 🔌 What It Defines

| Component        | Description                                     |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Cables**       | UTP (Ethernet), fiber, coax                     |
| **Connectors**   | RJ45, LC, ST                                    |
| **Voltage levels** | Defines binary 0 and 1 in terms of electrical signals |
| **Modulation**   | How signals are shaped for transmission         |
| **Speed**        | Bandwidth limits (e.g., 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps)       |
| **Pinouts**      | Cable wiring standards (e.g., T568A/B)          |

## 🖥️ Devices Operating at Layer 1

| Device            | Function                                 |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Hubs**          | Repeat signals to all ports              |
| **Cables**        | Carry signals physically                 |
| **NICs**          | Network Interface Cards, interface with physical media |
| **Modems**        | Modulate/demodulate signals              |

---

## 📡 Media Types

| Medium     | Example                   |
|------------|----------------------------|
| Copper     | Ethernet (UTP/STP cables)  |
| Fiber      | Single-mode, multi-mode    |
| Wireless   | Wi-Fi, Bluetooth           |

Each has different characteristics like:
- Maximum length
- Speed
- Susceptibility to interference

## ⚠️ Important Concept: Signal Transmission

All data — frames, packets, segments — are eventually turned into **signals**:

- **Electric signals** on copper
- **Light pulses** on fiber
- **Radio waves** in wireless

Those signals represent:

$$
10110110\ldots
$$

## 🔁 No Encapsulation at Layer 1

Layer 1 does **not add headers or trailers**.  
It simply **transmits** the bits passed down from Layer 2.

---

## 🔍 Example

When sending a ping:

- Layer 2 forms a frame
- Layer 1 converts the frame into a sequence of **bits**
- Sends those bits as **electrical pulses** over an Ethernet cable

## 🧪 Review Questions

1. What is the PDU name at Layer 1?
2. Name three physical media used at Layer 1.
3. Does Layer 1 perform encapsulation?
4. What type of devices operate at Layer 1?
