# 🪄 Presentation Layer (Layer 6)

## 🧠 What Does Layer 6 Do?

The **Presentation Layer** acts as the **translator** for data formats.

It converts data from the **application format** (used by software like a web browser) into a **network-friendly format**, and vice versa.

---

## 🔁 Main Responsibilities

1. **Translation between formats**  
   Example: Converts data from UTF-8 to ASCII, or JPEG to raw binary

2. **Encryption and decryption**  
   - Securely encodes the data before sending
   - Decrypts the data upon receiving

3. **Compression and decompression**  
   - Reduces file size before transmission (e.g., .zip, .mp3)
   - Expands data on the receiving end

---

## 📐 Role in the Data Flow

### On the Sender’s Side:
- Translates user data → encoded/compressed/encrypted format
- Passes to the **Session Layer (Layer 5)**

### On the Receiver’s Side:
- Receives the encoded/encrypted/compressed data
- Translates it back to a format the application can understand

## 🔐 Example: HTTPS (Secure Web)

When using `https://`:

1. Layer 7: Protocol = HTTPS  
2. Layer 6: 
   - Encrypts the data using TLS/SSL
   - Ensures secure delivery across an insecure network (like the Internet)

---

## 💬 Key Concept

> Layer 6 **makes data readable for the receiver**, and **secure or efficient for the sender**.

---

## 🔤 Simple Analogy

Sending a message in Morse code:

- Your words = application layer
- Morse encoding = presentation layer

Then:
- The recipient decodes Morse = presentation layer
- They read your words = application layer

---

## 🔐 Encryption Logic

Example encryption function at Layer 6:

$$
\text{Encrypted Data} = E(\text{Plain Data}, \text{Key})
$$

And decryption on the other side:

$$
\text{Plain Data} = D(\text{Encrypted Data}, \text{Key})
$$

Where:
- \( E \) = encryption function
- \( D \) = decryption function
- \( \text{Key} \) = shared encryption key (symmetric) or public/private key (asymmetric)

## 🧪 Review Questions

1. What is the purpose of the Presentation Layer?
2. What are examples of data formatting done at Layer 6?
3. Which layer is responsible for encrypting HTTPS traffic?
4. What is the difference between what Layer 6 and Layer 7 do?
