# 🌍 Network Layer (Layer 3)

## 🧠 What Does Layer 3 Do?

The **Network Layer** is responsible for **routing** data between different networks.

Main functions:
- **Logical addressing** (IP addresses)
- **Path selection** (routing)
- **Packet delivery** between **end hosts** across networks

---

## 🛣️ Layer 3 in Action

Imagine sending a letter:
- Street address = Layer 3 IP address
- The mail system = routing across the Internet

The Network Layer makes sure the packet **leaves the sender’s LAN** and finds a path to the **destination LAN**.

---

## 📦 Layer 3 PDU = Packet

Once the Transport Layer passes a segment to the Network Layer, a **Layer 3 header** is added (usually an **IP header**):

$$
\text{Packet} = \text{Layer 3 Header} + \text{Segment}
$$

---

## 🌐 IP Addressing

Layer 3 uses **logical addresses**:
- IPv4: 32 bits (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- IPv6: 128 bits (e.g., 2001:0db8::1)

Unlike MAC addresses (Layer 2), IP addresses:
- Can be assigned and changed
- Identify both **network** and **host**

---

## 🚦 Path Selection

When sending data to a remote network:
- Routers check the **destination IP**
- Use a **routing table** to forward the packet via the best path

This is called **path selection**.

## 📡 Layer 3 Devices

| Device  | Function                  |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Router  | Forwards packets between networks |
| Layer 3 Switch | Combines switch + router functionality |

## 🔁 Recap: Encapsulation Flow

From previous layers:

1. **Data** from Application Layer  
2. + Transport Layer Header → **Segment**  
3. + Network Layer Header (IP) → **Packet**

The packet is passed to Layer 2 for framing.

---

## 🧠 Key Characteristics of Layer 3

- Enables **internetwork communication**
- Adds **source and destination IP addresses**
- Determines **routing paths**
- Operates independently of physical medium

---

## 🔍 Example

If Host A (192.168.1.1) wants to send a packet to Host B (8.8.8.8):

- Network Layer wraps the segment with an IP header
- Routers examine the destination IP (8.8.8.8)
- Packet is forwarded hop-by-hop until it reaches Host B

---

## 📌 Packet Delivery = Best Path

Routers use protocols like:
- RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, BGP  
to determine the **best path** for packet delivery

## 🧪 Review Questions

1. What is the PDU name at Layer 3?
2. What type of address is used at the Network Layer?
3. What does a router do at Layer 3?
4. How does Layer 3 differ from Layer 2?
