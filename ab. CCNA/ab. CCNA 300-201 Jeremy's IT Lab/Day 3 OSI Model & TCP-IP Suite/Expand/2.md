# 📦 Encapsulation & Protocol Data Units (PDUs)

## 🔄 What Is Encapsulation?

**Encapsulation** is the process of adding layer-specific information (headers and sometimes trailers) to data as it moves **down the OSI model**, preparing it to be transmitted over the network.

### 🔁 The Opposite: De-Encapsulation
On the receiving side, each layer **removes** its specific information as the data moves **up** the OSI model — this is called **de-encapsulation**.

## 🏗️ How Encapsulation Works

Starting from Layer 7 and going down to Layer 1:

1. **Application Layer** creates the data.
2. **Transport Layer** adds a **Layer 4 header**.
3. **Network Layer** adds a **Layer 3 header**.
4. **Data Link Layer** adds a **Layer 2 header and trailer**.
5. **Physical Layer** converts it to bits and sends it.

This process turns "data" into structured units known as **PDUs** (Protocol Data Units).

## 📐 PDU Names at Each Layer

| OSI Layer            | PDU Name   | Description                         |
|----------------------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| 7-5 (Upper Layers)   | Data       | Original user data                  |
| 4 (Transport)        | Segment    | Data + Layer 4 header               |
| 3 (Network)          | Packet     | Segment + Layer 3 header (IP)       |
| 2 (Data Link)        | Frame      | Packet + Layer 2 header & trailer   |
| 1 (Physical)         | Bits       | Frame converted to 1s and 0s        |

## 🧪 Example: From PC to PC

When PC1 sends an HTTP request to PC2:

1. **App Layer**: HTTP data
2. **L4**: Adds TCP header → **Segment**
3. **L3**: Adds IP header → **Packet**
4. **L2**: Adds Ethernet header + trailer → **Frame**
5. **L1**: Transmits **bits**

PC2 reverses the process:
- Bits → Frame → Packet → Segment → Data

## 💬 Key Terms

- **Encapsulation**: Each layer adds its own information.
- **De-Encapsulation**: Receiving side removes the added info.
- **PDU**: The name for data at a specific OSI layer.
- **Header**: Info added at the beginning (e.g., source/dest IP).
- **Trailer**: Info added at the end (e.g., FCS in Ethernet).

## 🧠 Memory Tip: PDU Layers

A quick way to remember PDU names:

- **S**egment → Transport
- **P**acket → Network
- **F**rame → Data Link
- **B**its → Physical

## ✍️ Summary Formula (Host Bits)

To calculate usable IP addresses in a subnet:
$$
\text{Usable Hosts} = 2^h - 2
$$
Where:
- \( h \) = number of **host bits** in the subnet mask
- Subtract 2: one for **network** address, one for **broadcast**

This is important because the structure of a **frame** and **packet** relies on knowing how the addresses and networks are defined.

## 🧠 Same-layer vs Adjacent-layer Interaction

- **Adjacent-layer interaction**: Within the same device, Layer 4 passes data to Layer 3, and so on.
- **Same-layer interaction**: Two computers talking to each other’s Layer 4, 3, 2, etc.

## 🧪 Review Questions

1. What happens during encapsulation?
2. What are PDUs and what do they represent?
3. What is the PDU at Layer 3 called?
4. What do you subtract from \( 2^h \) to get usable host addresses?
