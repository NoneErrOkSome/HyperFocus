Based on the **Day 3 - OSI Model & TCP-IP Suite** slides and transcript, here is a list of the topics covered:

### **Topics from Day 3 Slides (OSI Model & TCP/IP Suite)**

1. **Introduction to Networking Models**
    
    - Definition of networking models
    - Role of protocols and standards
2. **OSI Model Overview**
    
    - Purpose and structure of OSI Model
    - The seven OSI layers:
        - **Layer 7: Application Layer** (Protocols like HTTP, HTTPS)
        - **Layer 6: Presentation Layer** (Data formatting and encryption)
        - **Layer 5: Session Layer** (Session management)
        - **Layer 4: Transport Layer** (Host-to-host communication, segmentation)
        - **Layer 3: Network Layer** (IP addressing, routing)
        - **Layer 2: Data Link Layer** (MAC addressing, error detection)
        - **Layer 1: Physical Layer** (Cabling, physical connections)
3. **Encapsulation & De-encapsulation**
    
    - Process of data encapsulation through the OSI layers
    - Protocol Data Units (PDU)
        - **Segment (Layer 4)**
        - **Packet (Layer 3)**
        - **Frame (Layer 2)**
        - **Bits (Layer 1)**
4. **TCP/IP Model**
    
    - Differences between OSI and TCP/IP models
    - TCP/IP layers:
        - **Application Layer** (Includes OSI Layers 7, 6, and 5)
        - **Transport Layer** (Same as OSI Layer 4)
        - **Internet Layer** (Same as OSI Layer 3)
        - **Link Layer** (Combines OSI Layers 1 and 2)
5. **Comparison: OSI vs. TCP/IP**
    
    - Key differences and similarities
    - How network engineers refer to OSI layers
6. **Real-world Example**
    
    - How data flows from **Host A → Router → Router → Host B** using the OSI model
    - De-encapsulation at each step
7. **Key Terms & Concepts**
    
    - Same-layer interaction
    - Adjacent-layer interaction
    - Role of network devices (switches, routers, hosts)
8. **Acronyms for Remembering OSI Layers**
    
    - **Mnemonic for OSI (Top to Bottom)**: _All People Seem To Need Data Processing_
    - **Mnemonic for OSI (Bottom to Top)**: _Please Do Not Teach Students Pointless Acronyms_

### **Topics from Day 3 Transcript**

The transcript closely follows the slides and includes:

- Expanded explanations on the **OSI model** and **TCP/IP suite**
- Detailed discussion on **encapsulation and de-encapsulation**
- More real-world examples, like how **Skype or YouTube** communicate over networks
- Explanation of **how routers and switches interact** at different layers
- Review questions and explanations

This covers all the main topics from **Day 3** as detailed in the slides and the transcript. Let me know if you need further details on any specific section!
