Perfect! Here's your **Day 4 Lab** breakdown — explained step-by-step for **each part** just like in the video, using **clear and casual language** so it sticks. Each step is practical and builds on the last one.

### ✅ **Step 1: Set Hostnames**

You’re just renaming your devices to make them easy to identify.

**What to do:**

1. Enter **privileged exec mode**:
    
    ```
    enable
    ```
    
2. Go into **global config mode**:
    
    ```
    configure terminal
    ```
    
3. Set the hostname:
    
    ```
    hostname R1
    ```
    
    For the switch:
    
    ```
    hostname SW1
    ```
    

🔹 Now you’ll see the prompt change from `Router(config)#` to `R1(config)#`.

---

### ✅ **Step 2: Set an Unencrypted Enable Password**

This sets a password to access **privileged exec mode**, but it's still visible in plain text.

**Command:**

```bash
enable password CCNA
```

You're still in global config mode, so no need to switch modes.

---

### ✅ **Step 3: Test the Enable Password**

Let’s see if the password works!

**Steps:**

1. Exit twice:
    
    ```
    exit
    exit
    ```
    
    Now you're back to user exec mode (router> prompt).
    
2. Try entering privileged mode again:
    
    ```
    enable
    ```
    
    You'll be asked for a password. Enter `CCNA` — it should let you in.
    

🛑 Try entering the wrong password 3 times — you’ll get a “bad secrets” message.

---

### ✅ **Step 4: View the Running Configuration**

Let’s check the password in the config.

**Command:**

```bash
show running-config
```

You’ll see:

```
enable password CCNA
```

🔓 It’s visible in clear text — not safe at all!

---

### ✅ **Step 5: Enable Password Encryption**

This scrambles the password using weak encryption (type 7).

**Command:**

```bash
service password-encryption
```

You’re still in global config mode, so you can run it right away.

---

### ✅ **Step 6: View the Running Config Again**

Let’s see the encrypted version.

If you’re still in config mode, add `do` before the command:

```bash
do show running-config
```

Now you’ll see something like:

```
enable password 7 104D000A0618
```

🔒 This is type 7 encryption — not super secure, but better than plain text.

---

### ✅ **Step 7: Set an Encrypted Enable Secret Password**

Now use a **stronger password** with **MD5 encryption**.

**Command:**

```bash
enable secret Cisco
```

This one overrides the regular `enable password` if both are set.

---

### ✅ **Step 8: Test the Secret Password**

Exit to user mode and try logging in again.

```bash
exit
exit
enable
```

Try typing `CCNA` → ❌ It won’t work.

Now try:

```
Cisco
```

✅ You’re in! The **secret password overrides** the regular one.

---

### ✅ **Step 9: View Passwords in the Running Config**

Run:

```bash
show running-config
```

You’ll now see:

```
enable password 7 104D000A0618
enable secret 5 $1$kJdk$A4T...
```

- Type **7** = weak encryption (`enable password`)
    
- Type **5** = MD5 encryption (`enable secret`)
    

---

### ✅ **Step 10: Save Your Configuration**

Don’t lose your work! Save the current config to startup.

Any of these will work:

```bash
write
```

or

```bash
write memory
```

or

```bash
copy running-config startup-config
```

Then verify:

```bash
show startup-config
```

You’ll see the saved config with all your settings.
