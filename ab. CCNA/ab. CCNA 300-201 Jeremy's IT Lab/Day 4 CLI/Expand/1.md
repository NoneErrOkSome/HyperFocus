Great! Here's **Part 1** presented as a **clean study note**, focused on the **physical setup and console access** portion of the video. It's written in a casual but thorough way for clarity.

## 🧰 Part 1: Physical Setup & Console Access to Cisco CLI

---

### 🧠 What is Cisco IOS?

- **IOS = Internetwork Operating System**
    
- It’s like Windows or macOS, but for Cisco routers and switches.
    
- Not to be confused with **Apple's iOS** (totally unrelated).
    
- IOS controls how Cisco devices operate and are configured.

### 💻 CLI vs GUI

|Type|Meaning|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**CLI**|Command Line Interface|Text-based interface. Preferred by network engineers for precision and speed.|
|**GUI**|Graphical User Interface|Click-based, like Cisco’s ASDM (used for firewalls). Not covered in this course.|

### 🔌 How Do You Connect to a Cisco Device?

To start configuring a Cisco router or switch, you **physically connect** to it using the **console port**.

#### 🎯 Console Port Options

- **RJ45 Console Port** (looks like a regular Ethernet port)
    
- **USB Mini-B Port** (similar to old PlayStation 3 controller ports)
    

You can use either one to access the CLI.

### 🧵 Required Cable & Adapter

#### 🟦 Rollover Cable

- **Also called**: Cisco console cable
    
- One end: **RJ45**
    
- Other end: **DB9 serial connector**
    
- **Pinout is reversed**:
    
    - pin 1 → pin 8
        
    - pin 2 → pin 7
        
    - pin 3 → pin 6
        
    - pin 4 ↔ pin 5
        

#### 🟨 USB Adapter

- Needed because **modern laptops** don’t have a serial port.
    
- Use a **DB9-to-USB** adapter to plug into your laptop.
    

📝 **Important**: Don’t confuse a **rollover cable** with a **crossover Ethernet cable**. Different purpose, different wiring.

### 🖥️ Terminal Emulator Software

To interact with the CLI, you need a terminal emulator like **PuTTY**.

#### 💡 PuTTY Setup Steps:

1. Download from [putty.org](https://putty.org/)
    
2. Choose **Serial** as the connection type.
    
3. Default COM port is usually `COM3` or similar.
    
4. Click **Open** to start the session.

### ⚙️ Serial Communication Settings

These are the default serial settings for Cisco console access:

|Setting|Value|
|---|---|
|**Speed (Baud rate)**|`9600` bits/sec|
|**Data bits**|`8`|
|**Stop bits**|`1`|
|**Parity**|`None`|
|**Flow control**|`None`|

You usually don’t need to change them, but it’s **good to memorize** them for the exam.

### 🪛 What Happens After You Connect?

1. You’ll see a boot-up message or prompt.
    
2. It may ask:
    
    ```
    Would you like to enter the initial configuration dialog? [yes/no]:
    ```
    
    Answer: `no`
    
3. Hit **Enter** to access the CLI.
    
4. You'll land in **User EXEC Mode** (`Router>`), which we’ll cover in Part 2.
