To cover **all the details** in the CLI intro video **thoroughly but digestibly**, I’d suggest splitting it into **5 detailed parts**, each with its own focus.

### ✅ **Part 1: Physical Setup & Console Access**

- What is Cisco IOS?
    
- CLI vs GUI
    
- Physical access via console port
    
- RJ45 vs USB mini-B console ports
    
- Rollover cable and DB9-to-USB adapter
    
- Serial communication defaults:
    
    - Speed: `9600`
        
    - Data bits: `8`
        
    - Stop bit: `1`
        
    - Parity: `none`
        
    - Flow control: `none`
        
- Using PuTTY

### ✅ **Part 2: CLI Navigation & Modes**

- Bootup process
    
- Initial dialog (yes/no)
    
- User EXEC Mode:
    
    - Prompt: `>`
        
    - Limited access
        
- Privileged EXEC Mode:
    
    - Prompt: `#`
        
    - Entered using `enable` or `en`
        
- Global Configuration Mode:
    
    - Prompt: `(config)#`
        
    - Entered using `configure terminal` or `conf t`
        
- Tab completion and `?` help
    
- Ambiguous commands & shortest unique prefixes

### ✅ **Part 3: Password Configuration & Security**

- Setting `enable password`
    
- How Cisco handles password input (not displayed)
    
- Password case-sensitivity
    
- Testing password lockout
    
- `enable secret` vs `enable password`
    
- Password visibility in `running-config`
    
- Using `service password-encryption` (Type 7)
    
- `enable secret` uses Type 5 (MD5)
    
- Precedence: `enable secret` overrides `enable password`

### ✅ **Part 4: Configuration Files & Saving Changes**

- Two main files:
    
    - `running-config` (active)
        
    - `startup-config` (loaded on reboot)
        
- Viewing:
    
    - `show running-config`
        
    - `show startup-config`
        
- Saving:
    
    - `write`
        
    - `write memory`
        
    - `copy running-config startup-config`
        
- Using `do` from config mode

### ✅ **Part 5: Modifying & Removing Configurations + Review**

- `no` command to remove configurations
    
- Effect of removing `service password-encryption`
    
- Password encryption summary:
    
    - Enabling encrypts existing and future passwords
        
    - Disabling does **not** decrypt existing ones
        
- Recap of all modes and commands
    
- Final quiz + answer explanations

Would you like me to start with **Part 1** and build it like a clean note, CLI tutorial, or Markdown file?
