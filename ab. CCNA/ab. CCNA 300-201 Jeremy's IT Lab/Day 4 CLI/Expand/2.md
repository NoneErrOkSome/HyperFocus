Absolutely! Here's **Part 2: CLI Navigation & Modes** — structured clearly for learning, written casually but with all the technical accuracy.

## 🚦 Part 2: CLI Navigation & Modes in Cisco IOS

---

### 🧭 Starting Point: CLI Boot-Up

Once you've connected to the device through the console port and terminal software (like PuTTY), you’ll land at the **CLI prompt**.

#### First Boot:

- Cisco may ask:
    
    ```
    Would you like to enter the initial configuration dialog? [yes/no]:
    ```
    
    ✨ Just type `no` and press **Enter**.
    
- Press **Enter** again to get to the prompt.

### 🧩 Modes in the CLI: Think of Them Like "Access Levels"

There are different **modes** in the Cisco CLI. Each gives you different levels of control.

---

### 🔹 1. User EXEC Mode

- **Prompt:** `Router>`
    
- **Permission Level:** 🔒 Very limited — view-only
    
- You **can’t make changes** here, but you can:
    
    - Run some basic **show** commands
        
    - Check status
        
    - Use `ping` or `traceroute`
        

📝 Also called: "user mode"

---

### 🔸 2. Privileged EXEC Mode

- **Command to enter:** `enable` (or shortcut: `en`)
    
- **Prompt:** `Router#`
    
- **Permission Level:** 🔓 Full read-access to device
    
- You **can’t configure**, but you can:
    
    - View **entire configuration**
        
    - Save files
        
    - Reboot the device
        
    - Enter global config mode
        

💡 You can recognize you’re in this mode by the **`#`** symbol in the prompt.

---

### 🟡 3. Global Configuration Mode

- **Command to enter:** `configure terminal` or `conf t`
    
- **Prompt:** `Router(config)#`
    
- **Permission Level:** 🛠️ This is where you make actual changes to the config.
    

From here, you can:

- Set passwords
    
- Rename the router
    
- Configure interfaces
    
- Add routes and other services
    

---

### ⚙️ Nested Configuration Modes (inside Global Config)

Once in `config` mode, you can enter **more specific modes**, like:

|Mode|Prompt|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|**Interface mode**|`Router(config-if)#`|Configure individual interfaces|
|**Line mode**|`Router(config-line)#`|Configure console or VTY (SSH/Telnet) lines|
|**Router mode**|`Router(config-router)#`|Configure routing protocols|

---

### ⌨️ Helpful CLI Shortcuts

|Shortcut|What It Does|
|---|---|
|`Tab`|Auto-completes a command|
|`?`|Shows possible commands|
|`?` after space|Shows options for that command|
|`en`|Short for `enable`|
|`conf t`|Short for `configure terminal`|
|`ex`|Short for `exit`|

---

### 🔍 Example: Using `?` to Discover Commands

Let’s say you're in user EXEC mode:

```plaintext
Router> e?
  enable    exit
```

If you type just:

```plaintext
Router> e
```

It’ll give you:

```plaintext
% Ambiguous command: "e"
```

That’s because both `enable` and `exit` start with `e`.

✅ But:

```plaintext
Router> en
```

Works fine — only `enable` starts with `en`.

---

### 🧠 Visualizing Mode Flow

```plaintext
[User EXEC Mode]      Router> 
       |
    enable
       ↓
[Privileged EXEC]     Router#
       |
 configure terminal
       ↓
[Global Config]       Router(config)#
       |
interface G0/0, line vty 0 4, etc.
```
