## 🔐 Part 3: Password Configuration & Security in Cisco IOS

---

### 🎯 Goal

You don’t want _just anyone_ typing `enable` and messing with your router or switch.

Let’s learn how to **secure the CLI** — especially the transition to **Privileged EXEC Mode**.

---

### 🗝️ Setting an `enable` Password (Basic)

Once you're in **global configuration mode** (`Router(config)#`), you can set a password to protect the `enable` command like this:

```bash
enable password CCNA
```

> 🔒 Now, if someone tries to type `enable` from user mode, they’ll need to enter the password `CCNA`.

---

### 🚨 Password Visibility in Running Config

If you run:

```bash
show running-config
```

You’ll see:

```bash
enable password CCNA
```

🧨 **This is a huge security risk** — it’s **stored in plain text**!

---

### 🧼 How to Encrypt Plain Text Passwords

Use this command in **global config mode**:

```bash
service password-encryption
```

This scrambles all plain-text passwords into a **Type 7 encrypted string** like:

```bash
enable password 7 08026F6028
```

> 📌 The password is still `CCNA`, just displayed differently.

🧠 But don’t get too excited — **Type 7 is weak**. Anyone can decrypt it using an online tool.

---

### 🧱 What is Enable Secret?

If you want real protection, **use this instead**:

```bash
enable secret Cisco
```

✅ This creates a **Type 5 (MD5) encrypted password** in the config:

```bash
enable secret 5 $1$kjsdf.... (etc.)
```

**Much harder to crack** than Type 7. Still not bulletproof, but much better.

> 📝 **Passwords are case-sensitive**. `Cisco` ≠ `cisco`

---

### 🥊 What if You Use Both?

```bash
enable password CCNA
enable secret Cisco
```

Only one is actually used.

> ✅ The **enable secret takes priority** — `enable password` is **ignored**.

---

### 🧪 Testing the Password

Let’s say you logout, go back to `Router>` prompt, and type:

```bash
enable
```

It’ll ask you for the password. When you type it in, **nothing shows** — no asterisks, no feedback. That’s normal.

If you enter it wrong **3 times**, you’ll see something like:

```bash
% Bad secrets
```

(And that’s not a philosophical judgment — it just means "wrong password.")

---

### ❌ Removing Passwords or Configs

Use the `no` command in global config mode:

```bash
no enable password
no enable secret
```

If you want to disable encryption of passwords **going forward**:

```bash
no service password-encryption
```

> 🔍 Existing passwords stay encrypted — they **aren’t decrypted**. Only future ones will go back to plain text.

---

### 🔁 Summary Table

|Command|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`enable password [pass]`|Sets an unencrypted (or weakly encrypted) password|
|`enable secret [pass]`|Sets a **strong, always encrypted** password|
|`service password-encryption`|Encrypts all plain-text passwords using Type 7|
|`no service password-encryption`|Future passwords stay plain-text (existing stay encrypted)|
|`no enable password`|Removes the enable password|
|`no enable secret`|Removes the secret password|
