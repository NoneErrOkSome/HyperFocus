## 🔄 Part 3: Auto-Negotiation + Mismatches (How Interfaces Negotiate Speed & Duplex)

Auto-negotiation is a great feature that keeps things smooth _when everything works as it should_. But when it's not configured right — or one side doesn’t support it — you can end up with confusing problems.

Let’s break it all down in human terms.

---

### ⚙️ 3.1 What Is Auto-Negotiation?

**Auto-Negotiation** is a Layer 1 (Physical Layer) feature that allows two connected devices to:

- Advertise their **speed capabilities** (e.g. 10, 100, 1000 Mbps)
    
- Advertise their **duplex mode** (full or half)
    
- Agree on the **highest performance** both support
    

📘 **Default setting** on Cisco switches and routers:

```bash
speed auto
duplex auto
```

✅ This means **no manual configuration is required** for most setups.

---

### 🧠 3.2 What Happens During Auto-Negotiation?

When two interfaces are connected and both use `auto`, they follow this process:

1. Exchange **Fast Link Pulses (FLPs)**.
    
2. Share **capabilities** like speed and duplex support.
    
3. Agree on the **best match** (e.g., 1000 Mbps full duplex).
    
4. Use that configuration for communication.
    

📝 If both devices support gigabit Ethernet and full duplex, that’s what they’ll settle on.

### ⚠️ 3.3 What If One Side Disables Auto-Negotiation?

Now it gets interesting (and dangerous).

Let’s say:

- Device A: `speed auto`, `duplex auto`
    
- Device B: manually configured `speed 100`, `duplex full`
    

#### What will happen?

1. Device A will **sense the speed** (using signal characteristics).
    
    - ✅ Succeeds → sets speed to **100 Mbps**
        
2. Device A **cannot sense duplex** (duplex must be negotiated).
    
    - ❌ Fails → defaults to **half duplex**
        

This causes a **duplex mismatch**:

- One side (A) is **half duplex**.
    
- Other side (B) is **full duplex**.
    

Result? 😵

- Collisions
    
- Late collisions
    
- CRC errors
    
- Laggy connections
    
- Users complaining

### 📊 3.4 Cisco Switch Behavior (Auto vs Manual)

Here’s how a Cisco switch behaves in different combinations:

|Device A (Switch)|Device B (Other End)|Result: Speed|Result: Duplex|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Auto|Auto|✅ Best match|✅ Best match|👍|
|Auto|Manual (100/full)|✅ Senses 100|❌ Uses Half|⚠ Duplex mismatch|
|Manual (100/full)|Auto|✅ 100|✅ Full|👍|
|Manual (100/half)|Manual (100/full)|✅ 100|❌ Mismatch|❌ Worst case|

> 📘 Gigabit Ethernet **requires full duplex** by standard. So, duplex mismatch is mostly an issue on 10/100 links.

---

### 🔍 3.5 How to Identify a Duplex Mismatch

Use these commands:

#### On the switch:

```bash
show interfaces status
```

Look for:

- `full` vs `half` duplex mismatches
    
- High number of **input errors**, **collisions**, or **late collisions**
    

#### Detailed check:

```bash
show interfaces FastEthernet0/1
```

Look for:

- **Runts**: often a sign of collisions
    
- **CRC errors**
    
- **Output errors**
    
- **Collisions**

### 👨‍💻 3.6 Real-World Example

Let’s say SW1 connects to SW2:

- SW1 (auto-negotiation ON)
    
- SW2 (manual 100 Mbps full duplex)
    

What happens?

- Speed: 100 Mbps ✅
    
- Duplex:
    
    - SW2 is full duplex
        
    - SW1 can’t detect that → sets to **half duplex** ❌
        

**Result**: Mismatch. You’ll see:

- Sluggish file transfers
    
- Broken VoIP calls
    
- Weird packet drops
    
- CRC and runts increasing like crazy
    

✅ **Fix**: Enable auto-negotiation on both ends **or** manually match both sides **exactly**.

### 💡 3.7 Best Practices for Auto-Negotiation

|Scenario|Recommended Setup|
|---|---|
|Modern Devices|Leave `auto` on both ends|
|Legacy or flaky devices|Manually configure **speed and duplex on both ends**|
|Inter-switch links|Prefer `auto` unless instructed otherwise|
|Troubleshooting performance|Check for mismatches and reset both to `auto` if needed|

### 🧾 Recap: Auto-Negotiation Summary

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|**Auto-Negotiation**|Devices talk and agree on speed + duplex|
|**Speed Sensing**|Possible even without negotiation|
|**Duplex Detection**|❌ Not possible without negotiation|
|**Mismatch Symptoms**|Collisions, CRC errors, runts|
|**Solution**|Match both ends: auto-auto OR manual-manual|
