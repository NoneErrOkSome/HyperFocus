Here’s **Part 6** — all about **duplex modes**, why **half-duplex** even existed in the first place, how **hubs caused collisions**, and how **CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)** worked to deal with that. As always, it’s casual but serious, with full terms, short forms, and simple breakdowns.

## ⚡ Part 6: Duplex Modes, Hubs, Collisions & CSMA/CD

If you’ve ever wondered _why_ full duplex is such a big deal—or what "CSMA/CD" even means—this is the section for you. It goes back to the roots of Ethernet and how networking worked **before switches** became the norm.

### 🧭 6.1 Quick Review — What Is Duplex?

- **Half-Duplex**:
    
    - A device can **either send or receive**, but **not both at the same time**.
        
    - Think walkie-talkie.
        
- **Full-Duplex**:
    
    - A device can **send and receive at the same time**.
        
    - Think smartphone call.
        

✅ Modern networks run **full-duplex everywhere**. ❌ Half-duplex is rare—but understanding it helps explain legacy Ethernet behavior and certain error types.

### 🧱 6.2 What Caused Half-Duplex? — Enter the Hub

Before switches, we had **hubs**.

- A **hub** is a **Layer 1 device**.
    
- It’s basically an **electrical repeater**.
    
- Whatever signal goes in one port, gets blasted out of **all other ports**.
    

#### Problem:

- If **two devices transmit at once**, their signals **collide** on the wire.
    
- This results in **data corruption**.
    

These collisions happen because **every device shares the same transmission space** — aka a **collision domain**.

---

### 🔄 6.3 Collision Domains

|Device|Collision Domain Behavior|
|---|---|
|**Hub**|All ports share **one collision domain** ⚠|
|**Switch**|Each port has its **own collision domain** ✅|

> 💡 So if you connect 3 PCs to a **hub**, they all share the same domain. If two send at the same time → collision.  
> With a **switch**, they each get a private lane — no collisions.

### 🧠 6.4 What Is CSMA/CD?

**CSMA/CD** stands for:

> **Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection**

It’s a method for **detecting and managing collisions** in half-duplex Ethernet.

#### How CSMA/CD Works:

1. **Carrier Sense**: Device listens first to see if the wire is busy.
    
2. **Multiple Access**: All devices share access to the medium.
    
3. **Send Frame**: If clear, device sends.
    
4. **Collision Detection**: If a collision occurs, the device detects it.
    
5. **Jamming Signal**: Sent to alert all devices of the collision.
    
6. **Random Backoff**: Devices wait a random time before trying again.
    

> 🔄 If no one sends at the same time → no problem.  
> ❌ If two devices misjudge timing → collision happens.

### 📉 6.5 Why CSMA/CD Is Basically Dead

Because **modern switches** give every device its own dedicated port:

- **No collisions**
    
- **No need for CSMA/CD**
    
- **Full duplex can be used everywhere**
    

Also:

- **Gigabit Ethernet and faster** doesn’t even support half-duplex at all.
    
- **Hubs are obsolete** (but might still show up in very old setups or exam questions).

### 🧪 6.6 Example: Hub vs Switch

#### With a Hub:

- PC1 sends a frame to PC2.
    
- Hub repeats it to **all ports**.
    
- PC3 also gets the frame.
    
- If PC3 sends at the same time → collision occurs.
    

#### With a Switch:

- PC1 sends a frame to PC2.
    
- Switch looks at the **MAC address table**.
    
- Forwards frame **only to PC2’s port**.
    
- No one else sees it = **no collision**.

### 🔍 6.7 Why Should You Still Care?

You might see **runts**, **CRC errors**, or **late collisions** on a modern network.

Sometimes, it’s because:

- An old device is forcing half-duplex.
    
- There’s a **duplex mismatch** (see Part 3).
    
- There’s a **bad cable** or broken NIC (network interface card).
    

Knowing CSMA/CD helps explain **why those symptoms show up**, even when everything _looks_ connected.

### 🧾 Recap: Duplex, Hubs, and CSMA/CD

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**Half-Duplex**|Send or receive, not both|
|**Full-Duplex**|Send and receive at the same time|
|**Hub**|Repeater; causes collisions|
|**Collision Domain**|Area where collisions can occur|
|**CSMA/CD**|Method for avoiding/dealing with collisions|
|**Modern Switches**|Use full duplex, no collisions|
