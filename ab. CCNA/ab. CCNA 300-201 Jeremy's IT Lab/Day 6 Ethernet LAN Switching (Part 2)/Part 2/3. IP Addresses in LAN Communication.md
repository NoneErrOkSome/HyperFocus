## 🌐 **Part 3: IP Addresses in LAN Communication**

Now that we know about MAC addresses and Ethernet frames, let’s bring in **IP addresses** — these work at a different layer (Layer 3) but are still crucial for communication within the LAN.

We’ll explain why both **IP addresses** and **MAC addresses** are needed, and how they work **together** in the local network.

### 🗺️ What is an IP Address?

- **IP** = **Internet Protocol**
    
- An IP address is a **logical address** assigned to a device in a network.
    
- Think of it like a **mailing address** for your home: it tells the network where the device is located **in terms of the network structure**, not the physical hardware.
    

📌 **Example IP Address (IPv4):**

```
192.168.1.3
```

This address is used at **OSI Layer 3** — the **Network Layer**.

### 🧠 Key Differences: IP vs MAC

|Feature|IP Address|MAC Address|
|---|---|---|
|**Full Form**|Internet Protocol Address|Media Access Control Address|
|**Layer**|Layer 3 – Network Layer|Layer 2 – Data Link Layer|
|**Type**|Logical address (assigned)|Physical address (burned-in)|
|**Changes?**|Can change (e.g. DHCP)|Usually fixed|
|**Format**|32-bit (IPv4) or 128-bit (IPv6)|48-bit hexadecimal|
|**Example**|`192.168.1.1`|`0C2F.B011.9D00`|
|**Used for**|Routing traffic between networks|Switching traffic within a network|

### 🧑‍💻 Scenario: Sending Data in a LAN

Let’s say PC1 wants to send data to PC3. Here’s what it knows:

- PC3’s **IP address**: `192.168.1.3`
    
- But it doesn’t know PC3’s **MAC address**
    

This is normal, because most apps and users work with IPs (not MACs).  
But the Ethernet switch needs the **MAC address** to forward the frame.  
So how does PC1 find it?

---

### 🧩 The Role of ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

- PC1 **knows the IP** of PC3, but not its MAC
    
- PC1 sends an **ARP Request**: "Who has 192.168.1.3? Tell 192.168.1.1"
    
- PC3 replies with its MAC
    
- Now PC1 stores that info in its **ARP Table** (IP-to-MAC mapping)
    

**Then** PC1 can build the Ethernet frame:

- **Source IP**: `192.168.1.1` (PC1)
    
- **Destination IP**: `192.168.1.3` (PC3)
    
- **Source MAC**: `0C2F.B011.9D00` (PC1)
    
- **Destination MAC**: `0C2F.B06A.3900` (PC3)

### 🏠 IP Addressing Scheme in Jeremy’s Lab

In Jeremy’s example network:

|**Device**|**IP Address**|**MAC (short)**|
|---|---|---|
|PC1|`192.168.1.1`|`9D00`|
|PC2|`192.168.1.2`|`6200`|
|PC3|`192.168.1.3`|`3900`|
|PC4|`192.168.1.4`|`1400`|

The network address is:

```
192.168.1.0/24
```

📌 `/24` = Subnet mask of `255.255.255.0`, meaning the **first 3 octets** (`192.168.1`) are the **network part**, and the last octet is for host addresses (from `.1` to `.254`).

---

### 📎 Why Use Both IP and MAC?

- MAC addresses are only used **inside the local network**
    
- IP addresses are used to **identify devices globally** and **route traffic**
    

You can’t send a frame across the network with just an IP address.  
The switch doesn’t know how to use it.  
You need the **MAC address** — and that’s what **ARP** helps you find.

---

### 🧾 Summary of Key Terms

|**Term**|**Full Form**|**Meaning**|
|---|---|---|
|IP Address|Internet Protocol Address|Logical address for a device on the network (Layer 3)|
|Subnet Mask|N/A|Defines which part of IP is network and which is host|
|ARP|Address Resolution Protocol|Resolves IP → MAC so Ethernet can send frames|
|ARP Table|N/A|Stores mappings of IP ↔ MAC locally on the device|
