## 🔍 **Part 4: ARP – Address Resolution Protocol**

Now that we know **IP addresses** identify devices logically and **MAC addresses** are used to actually send Ethernet frames on the local network, the **missing link** is how we get from IP to MAC.

That’s where **ARP** comes in.

---

### 🧠 What is ARP?

- **ARP** stands for **Address Resolution Protocol**
    
- It works at **OSI Layer 2.5** (between Data Link and Network Layers)
    
- Purpose: **Find the MAC address** that corresponds to a known **IP address**
    

📌 In short:  
You **know the IP**, but to actually send a frame, you need the **MAC**.  
ARP fills in that gap.

# 📡 How ARP Works – Step-by-Step

**Scenario:** PC1 wants to send data to PC3

- **PC1 knows:**
    
    - PC3’s **IP address**: `192.168.1.3`
        
    - Its own **MAC address**: `0C2F.B011.9D00`
        
- **PC1 does NOT know** PC3’s MAC address (yet)
    

---

## 🧩 Step 1: PC1 Sends an ARP Request (Broadcast)

**Message Meaning:**

> “Who has IP `192.168.1.3`? Tell `192.168.1.1`”

|Field|Value|
|---|---|
|**Source IP**|`192.168.1.1` (PC1)|
|**Destination IP**|`192.168.1.3` (PC3)|
|**Source MAC**|`0C2F.B011.9D00` (PC1’s MAC)|
|**Destination MAC**|`FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF` (Broadcast)|

🌀 **This frame is flooded** across the LAN because it’s a broadcast.

---

## 🧠 What the Switch Does:

- **Learns** PC1’s MAC → associates `0C2F.B011.9D00` with the port it came in on (if it hadn’t already)
    
- **Floods** the ARP request out **all other ports**
    

---

## 📨 Step 2: PC3 Receives the ARP Request

PC3 sees the IP matches its own (`192.168.1.3`), so it sends back an **ARP Reply** (Unicast).

**Message Meaning:**

> “I am `192.168.1.3`, and my MAC address is `0C2F.B06A.3900`.”

|Field|Value|
|---|---|
|**Source IP**|`192.168.1.3` (PC3)|
|**Destination IP**|`192.168.1.1` (PC1)|
|**Source MAC**|`0C2F.B06A.3900` (PC3’s MAC)|
|**Destination MAC**|`0C2F.B011.9D00` (PC1’s MAC)|

✅ This reply is **unicast** — it goes straight to PC1.

---

## 💾 Step 3: PC1 Updates Its ARP Table

PC1 stores the mapping in its **ARP cache**:

```
192.168.1.3 → 0C2F.B06A.3900
```

---

## 🚀 Step 4: PC1 Sends the Real Data

Now that PC1 knows PC3’s MAC address, it can send the **actual Ethernet frame** (unicast) directly:

|Header Info|Value|
|---|---|
|**Destination MAC**|`0C2F.B06A.3900` (PC3)|
|**Source MAC**|`0C2F.B011.9D00` (PC1)|
|**Payload**|Actual data (IP packet, etc.)|

The switch now **forwards** the frame directly using its MAC address table.

## ✅ Final Recap

|Step|Action|
|---|---|
|1️⃣|PC1 sends ARP request (broadcast)|
|2️⃣|Switch floods the request|
|3️⃣|PC3 replies with its MAC (unicast)|
|4️⃣|PC1 updates ARP table|
|5️⃣|PC1 sends data directly to PC3|

### 📡 ARP Request vs ARP Reply

|Message|Sent as|Destination MAC|Purpose|
|---|---|---|---|
|ARP Request|**Broadcast**|`FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`|Ask who owns the IP address|
|ARP Reply|**Unicast**|MAC of original requester|Respond with your MAC address|

### 🧾 ARP Table

Each device stores what it learns in a local **ARP table**.

📌 Commands to view it:

- **Windows/macOS/Linux:**
    
    ```
    arp -a
    ```
    
- **Cisco IOS (Switch/Router):**
    
    ```
    show arp
    ```
    

🗂️ Example ARP table:

|Internet Address|Physical Address|Type|
|---|---|---|
|192.168.1.3|0C2F.B06A.3900|Dynamic|
|192.168.1.1|0C2F.B011.9D00|Interface (self)|

- **Static** = manually configured or built-in (like own address)
    
- **Dynamic** = learned through ARP request/reply
    

---

### 💬 Why Broadcast First?

The reason ARP requests are **broadcast** is because the destination MAC is **unknown**. Until that info is discovered, there’s no way to direct the frame to just one device.

Once the MAC is known, future traffic is **unicast**, which is more efficient.

### 🔥 Real Packet Capture (Wireshark)

Jeremy uses **Wireshark** to show this:

- ARP Request:
    
    ```
    Who has 192.168.1.3? Tell 192.168.1.1
    ```
    
- ARP Reply:
    
    ```
    192.168.1.3 is at 0C2F.B06A.3900
    ```
    

You’ll also see the Ethernet Type field:

- **ARP** has a Type of `0x0806`
    
- **IPv4** is `0x0800`
    
- **IPv6** is `0x86DD`

### 🧾 Summary of Key Terms

|**Term**|**Full Form**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|ARP|Address Resolution Protocol|Resolves IP to MAC within the local network|
|ARP Request|—|Sent as broadcast to ask "Who owns this IP?"|
|ARP Reply|—|Sent as unicast to reply "I own this IP, here’s my MAC"|
|ARP Table|—|Local list of known IP ↔ MAC mappings|
|Broadcast MAC|—|`FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`, sends to all devices in the broadcast domain|
|Unicast MAC|—|A specific MAC address (normal one-to-one communication)|
