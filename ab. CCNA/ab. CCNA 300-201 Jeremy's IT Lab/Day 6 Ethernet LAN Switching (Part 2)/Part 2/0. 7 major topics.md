To clearly and casually explain all the key details from **Day 6: Ethernet LAN Switching Part 2**, we can break the entire lesson into **7 major topics**, each with subtopics that naturally build on one another. Here‚Äôs the clean breakdown:

---

### üß© 1. **Ethernet Frame Structure (More Details)**

- **Header components**: Destination MAC, Source MAC, Type (total 14 bytes)
    
- **Trailer**: Frame Check Sequence (4 bytes)
    
- **Preamble + SFD**: Sent with every frame, but **not** considered part of the header (adds 8 bytes before the header)
    

#### üìè **Minimum Frame Size**

$$
64\ \text{bytes (header + payload + trailer)} \Rightarrow \text{Payload must be at least } 46\ \text{bytes}
$$


- **Padding**: If payload < 46 bytes ‚Üí zeros are added as padding

### üß† 2. **MAC Addresses Refresher**

- Realistic MAC examples: `0C2F.B011.9D00`
    
- **OUI** (first half): Identifies the vendor
    
- **Last half**: Unique device ID
    
- Simplified names like ‚Äú9D00‚Äù used for clarity
    

---

### üåê 3. **IP Addresses in LAN**

- Added IPs to the LAN: `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.4`
    
- Not diving deep into IP yet, but needed for explaining ARP and ping
    
- IP address helps locate devices at **Layer 3**, while MAC is used at **Layer 2**
    

---

### üîç 4. **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**

- **Purpose**: Find the MAC address when you know the IP
    
- Two messages:
    
    - **ARP Request**: Broadcast to **everyone**
        
    - **ARP Reply**: Unicast back to the sender
        
- **Broadcast MAC**: `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`
    
- Once the MAC is known, it‚Äôs stored in the **ARP table**
    

---

### üíæ 5. **MAC Address Table on Switches**

- **Dynamic learning**: Switch learns MAC from incoming frames
    
- Entries show:
    
    - VLAN (default = 1)
        
    - MAC Address
        
    - Type (dynamic/static)
        
    - Interface/Port
        
- **Aging time**: Entries expire after 5 minutes of no traffic
    
- **Manual clearing**:
    
    - All: `clear mac address-table dynamic`
        
    - Specific MAC: `clear mac address-table dynamic address <MAC>`
        
    - Specific port: `clear mac address-table dynamic interface <INTF>`

### üì∂ 6. **Ping and ICMP Basics**

- **Ping** is a test to check if devices can reach each other
    
- Uses:
    
    - **ICMP Echo Request**
        
    - **ICMP Echo Reply**
        
- Not broadcast ‚Üí ARP must run first to find MAC
    
- Common issues:
    
    - First ping might fail due to ARP delay
        
- Command examples:
    
    - `ping 192.168.1.3`
        
    - `ping 192.168.1.3 size 36` (to show padding in Wireshark)
        

---

### üî¨ 7. **Wireshark and Real Packet Captures**

- **Captured ARP and ICMP frames**
    
- Frame analysis shows:
    
    - Ethernet Type (e.g. `0x0800` for IPv4)
        
    - Padding bytes (e.g. 10 bytes = 20 hex zeros)
        
    - ARP and ICMP headers clearly identified
        
- Useful for seeing what‚Äôs _actually_ happening on the wire
