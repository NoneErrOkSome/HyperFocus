## 📶 **Part 6: Ping and ICMP Basics**

Now that we know how Ethernet frames move between devices, and how ARP helps us resolve IP to MAC, it’s time to understand **how we test communication between devices** — using the famous command: **`ping`**.

Let’s break it all down casually, but with full seriousness about the concepts and terms.

---

### 🧠 What is Ping?

- `ping` is a **network utility** used to test whether one device can **reach another** on a network.
    
- It checks **connectivity** and measures **round-trip time** (RTT).
    
- Behind the scenes, it uses the **ICMP protocol**.

### 📡 What is ICMP?

- **ICMP** = **Internet Control Message Protocol**
    
- It is part of the **IP protocol suite** and works at **Layer 3 (Network Layer)**
    
- It’s used for **diagnostic and control messages** — not to send actual data
    

Ping uses **two specific ICMP message types**:

|ICMP Message Type|Name|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Type 8|Echo Request|"Are you there?"|
|Type 0|Echo Reply|"Yes, I'm here!"|

So ping works like this:

> PC1 sends an **ICMP Echo Request** to PC3  
> PC3 replies with an **ICMP Echo Reply**

### ⚙️ Ping Process Step-by-Step

Let’s use the lab example from Jeremy:

**PC1 wants to ping PC3 (`192.168.1.3`)**

#### 1. **PC1 sends a ping command:**

```bash
ping 192.168.1.3
```

#### 2. **PC1 checks its ARP table**

- If PC1 **doesn’t know** the MAC address of PC3 yet:
    
    - It sends an **ARP Request**
        
    - PC3 replies → PC1 stores it in the ARP table
        

#### 3. **PC1 sends ICMP Echo Request**

- Source IP: `192.168.1.1` (PC1)
    
- Destination IP: `192.168.1.3` (PC3)
    
- Source MAC: PC1's MAC
    
- Destination MAC: PC3’s MAC
    
- The frame is sent **unicast** (directly to PC3)
    

#### 4. **PC3 replies with ICMP Echo Reply**

- Swaps source and destination IP/MAC
    
- Sends frame back to PC1

### 🔁 Why Does the First Ping Fail Sometimes?

You might see something like:

```
Success rate is 80 percent (4/5)
```

This happens because:

- The first ping **fails** while ARP is still resolving the MAC address
    
- Once the MAC is known, the remaining pings **succeed**

### 💡 Ping Output (Cisco IOS)

```bash
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 192.168.1.3
.....
Success rate is 80 percent (4/5)
```

|Symbol|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`.`|Ping failed (timeout)|
|`!`|Ping succeeded|

🔧 Default:

- **5 pings**
    
- **100-byte size**
    
- You can customize the size:
    
    ```bash
    ping 192.168.1.3 size 36
    ```

### 🔬 Packet Capture with Wireshark

In Wireshark, you’ll see:

1. **ARP Request + Reply**  
    `Who has 192.168.1.3? → 192.168.1.3 is at MAC...`
    
2. **ICMP Echo Request**
    
    - Protocol: ICMP
        
    - Info: Echo (ping) request
        
3. **ICMP Echo Reply**
    
    - Protocol: ICMP
        
    - Info: Echo (ping) reply
        

🔎 Ping uses **Ethernet Type 0x0800** → This means IPv4

### 🧾 Summary of Key Terms

|**Term**|**Full Form**|**Meaning**|
|---|---|---|
|Ping|—|Utility to test if a device is reachable|
|ICMP|Internet Control Message Protocol|Protocol for error messages and operational info|
|Echo Request (Type 8)|—|Sent by initiator of the ping|
|Echo Reply (Type 0)|—|Response from the destination device|
|RTT|Round-Trip Time|Time it takes to go there and back|
|`.` (dot) in ping|—|Ping failed|
|`!` (bang) in ping|—|Ping successful|
|ARP|Address Resolution Protocol|Resolves IP to MAC before ICMP can be sent|
