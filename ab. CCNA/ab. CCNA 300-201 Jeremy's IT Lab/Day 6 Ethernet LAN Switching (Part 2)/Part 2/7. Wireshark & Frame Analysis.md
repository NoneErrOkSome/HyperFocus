## üî¨ **Part 7: Wireshark & Frame Analysis**

Now that we understand how Ethernet, MAC, ARP, and ICMP work, let‚Äôs talk about **how to observe it all in action** using a tool called **Wireshark**. This part ties everything together with **real packet captures**, letting you **see what‚Äôs happening under the hood** of the network.

### üß∞ What is Wireshark?

- **Wireshark** is a **packet analyzer** or **protocol analyzer**
    
- It captures live network traffic and shows **frame-by-frame details** of:
    
    - Ethernet headers
        
    - IP packets
        
    - ARP, ICMP, etc.
        
- Extremely useful for:
    
    - Studying protocols
        
    - Debugging network problems
        
    - Learning how traffic flows

### üîç Example: ARP + Ping Capture in Wireshark

Let‚Äôs walk through what Jeremy showed when he pinged PC3 from PC1:

#### üßµ First: ARP Exchange (MAC discovery)

1. **ARP Request**
    
    - **Source MAC**: `0C2F.B011.9D00` (PC1)
        
    - **Destination MAC**: `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF` (Broadcast)
        
    - **Protocol**: ARP (`0x0806`)
        
    - **Info**:
        
        ```
        Who has 192.168.1.3? Tell 192.168.1.1
        ```
        
2. **ARP Reply**
    
    - **Source MAC**: `0C2F.B06A.3900` (PC3)
        
    - **Destination MAC**: `0C2F.B011.9D00` (PC1)
        
    - **Info**:
        
        ```
        192.168.1.3 is at 0C2F.B06A.3900
        ```
        

These two packets complete the ARP process and allow PC1 to send ICMP.

#### üí¨ Then: ICMP Ping Process

3. **ICMP Echo Request**
    
    - **Source IP**: `192.168.1.1` (PC1)
        
    - **Destination IP**: `192.168.1.3` (PC3)
        
    - **Source MAC**: PC1
        
    - **Destination MAC**: PC3
        
    - **Protocol**: ICMP (`Type 8`)
        
    - **Info**: Echo (ping) request
        
4. **ICMP Echo Reply**
    
    - **Source IP**: `192.168.1.3` (PC3)
        
    - **Destination IP**: `192.168.1.1` (PC1)
        
    - **Protocol**: ICMP (`Type 0`)
        
    - **Info**: Echo (ping) reply

### üß© Frame Anatomy in Wireshark

For **each packet**, Wireshark shows:

|**Layer**|**Field**|**Example / Notes**|
|---|---|---|
|Layer 2|Ethernet Header|Source/Destination MAC, Type field (e.g. `0x0800`, `0x0806`)|
|Layer 3|IP Header|Source/Destination IP|
|Layer 4|ICMP/ARP details|Message type (Request/Reply), payload, checksum, etc.|

### üß™ Analyzing Padding in Wireshark

In Jeremy‚Äôs lab:

```bash
ping 192.168.1.3 size 36
```

- **Ethernet requires a minimum payload of 46 bytes**
    
- So: 36 bytes ping data + **10 bytes padding**
    
- Padding = **zeroes** (`00`) in hexadecimal
    

You‚Äôll see:

- Ethernet Type: `0x0800` (IPv4)
    
- 20 zeroes in hex ‚Üí **10 bytes of padding**

### üß† How to Identify Ethernet Type

Inside the Ethernet header, the **Type field** tells what kind of data is in the payload.

|**Ethernet Type**|**Hex Value**|**Protocol**|
|---|---|---|
|IPv4|`0x0800`|Internet Protocol v4|
|ARP|`0x0806`|Address Resolution Protocol|
|IPv6|`0x86DD`|Internet Protocol v6|

So when you're analyzing packets:

- `0x0800` ‚Üí IP
    
- `0x0806` ‚Üí ARP
    
- `0x86DD` ‚Üí IPv6
    

---

### üì∑ Screenshot Recap from Jeremy's Lab

- **Captured packets** show clear **ARP ‚Üí ICMP flow**
    
- You can see **MACs, IPs, protocol types, and even the padding**
    
- This helps **verify everything works** and shows **how protocols interact**
