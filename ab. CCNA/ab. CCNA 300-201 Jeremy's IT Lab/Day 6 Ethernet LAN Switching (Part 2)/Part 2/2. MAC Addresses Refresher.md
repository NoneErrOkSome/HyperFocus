## 🧠 **Part 2: MAC Addresses Refresher**

Let’s get deep into what **MAC addresses** are, how they work, and why they matter in Ethernet LAN switching. We’ll break it all down in a casual tone, but be **serious and complete** about every term, with both full forms and short forms clearly explained.

### 🪪 What is a MAC Address?

- **MAC** = **Media Access Control** address
    
- It’s a **unique identifier** assigned to each **network interface card (NIC)** by the manufacturer.
    
- Think of it like a **serial number** for your network device — but used to **identify you on the LAN**.
    

📌 **Format**:  
A MAC address is made up of **48 bits**, shown in **hexadecimal** format like this:

```
0C2F.B011.9D00
```

or like this:

```
0C:2F:B0:11:9D:00
```

### 🔍 MAC Address Structure

A MAC address is split into **two main parts**:

|Part|Size (bits)|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**OUI** (Organizationally Unique Identifier)|24 bits|Identifies the **vendor** or manufacturer|
|**Device ID** (NIC Specific)|24 bits|Unique for each device made by that vendor|

Example:

```
0C2F.B0 = OUI (e.g. Cisco, Intel, etc.)  
11.9D00 = Device ID
```

So when Jeremy uses examples like:

```
0C2F.B011.9D00 → PC1
0C2F.B06A.6200 → PC2
```

The **first half** (OUI) is **the same**, meaning **same vendor**.  
The **second half** is **unique**, representing the individual device.

### 🧠 Why Does MAC Address Matter in Ethernet Switching?

Ethernet switches operate at **OSI Layer 2** (the Data Link Layer).  
That means they use **MAC addresses**, not IP addresses, to make forwarding decisions.

Here’s how it works:

1. When a frame arrives at a switch, it reads the **Source MAC address** and learns **which port** that device is connected to.
    
2. It updates its **MAC address table** with:
    
    ```
    MAC Address → Port Number
    ```
    
3. Then it uses the **Destination MAC address** to decide **where to send** the frame.

### 💡 Simplified Names in Jeremy’s Lab

To keep diagrams and explanations simple, Jeremy uses **just the last 4 digits** of the MAC address.

For example:

- PC1 → MAC = `9D00`
    
- PC2 → MAC = `6200`
    
- PC3 → MAC = `3900`
    
- PC4 → MAC = `1400`
    

It’s still accurate — just shorthand for clarity.

### 🚫 MAC Address ≠ IP Address

Let’s make this very clear:

|MAC Address|IP Address|
|---|---|
|Physical address (burned into NIC)|Logical address (assigned by network)|
|Used in Layer 2 (Ethernet Switching)|Used in Layer 3 (Routing)|
|Never changes (usually)|Can change, even dynamically|
|Example: `0C2F.B011.9D00`|Example: `192.168.1.3`|

So even if you know someone’s IP address, you **can’t send a frame to them directly** on Ethernet.  
You need their MAC address. That’s why **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** exists — and we’ll cover that next.

### 🧾 Summary of Key Terms

|**Term**|**Full Form**|**Meaning**|
|---|---|---|
|MAC Address|Media Access Control Address|A unique 48-bit identifier for a device’s network interface|
|NIC|Network Interface Card|Hardware that connects your device to the network|
|OUI|Organizationally Unique Identifier|First half of MAC that identifies the manufacturer|
|Device ID|N/A|Second half of MAC that’s unique to that device|
