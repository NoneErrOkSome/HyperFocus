## 💾 **Part 5: MAC Address Table on Switches**

Switches are **Layer 2 devices**, and to intelligently forward Ethernet frames, they build and maintain a **MAC address table** (also known as a **Content Addressable Memory table**, or **CAM table**). Let's dive into how it works in clear terms but with complete seriousness.

---

### 🧠 What is a MAC Address Table?

A **MAC address table** is a list that a switch builds automatically. It maps:

```
MAC Address → Interface (Port)
```

So the switch knows **which port to send a frame to**, based on the destination MAC.

---

### 🛠️ How Switches Learn MAC Addresses

This process is called **dynamic learning**. Here's how it works:

1. A device sends an Ethernet frame.
    
2. The switch looks at the **source MAC address** of the frame.
    
3. It records that MAC address along with the **interface** the frame came from.
    
4. It adds or updates the entry in its MAC address table.
    

So if PC1 sends a frame and its MAC is `9D00`, and it came in on **GigabitEthernet0/0 (G0/0)**, the switch records:

```
9D00 → G0/0
```

> ✅ These are called **dynamic MAC addresses**, because the switch learned them automatically (not manually configured).

### 📋 What’s Inside the MAC Address Table?

When you run the command:

```bash
show mac address-table
```

You’ll see something like this:

|VLAN|MAC Address|Type|Ports|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|0C2F.B011.9D00|Dynamic|Gi0/0|
|1|0C2F.B06A.3900|Dynamic|Gi0/2|

Let’s break it down:

|**Column**|**Meaning**|
|---|---|
|**VLAN**|Virtual LAN the MAC is associated with (default is VLAN 1)|
|**MAC Address**|The actual 48-bit Media Access Control address|
|**Type**|How it was learned: usually **dynamic**, but could also be **static**|
|**Ports**|The interface (port) where the switch saw this MAC address|

---

### 🧺 What if the Switch Doesn’t Know the MAC?

If a switch receives a frame **and doesn’t yet have an entry** for the destination MAC:

- It **floods the frame** out of **all ports** (except the one it came in on)
    
- This is called an **unknown unicast flood**
    

If the destination is a **broadcast address** (`FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`), it does the same — sends it out **everywhere** (except the source port)

---

### ⏱️ MAC Address Table Aging

- Entries in the MAC address table **don’t last forever**.
    
- If the switch **doesn’t see traffic from a MAC address for 5 minutes**, it removes it.
    
- This process is called **aging**.
    

⏳ Default **aging time**:

```
300 seconds (5 minutes)
```

---

### 🧹 Clearing the MAC Address Table (Manually)

You can **manually clear** entries with these commands in Cisco IOS:

#### 🧼 Clear all dynamic MACs:

```bash
clear mac address-table dynamic
```

#### 🔍 Clear one specific MAC:

```bash
clear mac address-table dynamic address 0C2F.B011.9D00
```

#### 🔌 Clear all MACs from a specific interface:

```bash
clear mac address-table dynamic interface gi0/0
```

🧠 These commands are useful for **testing, troubleshooting, or refreshing** the learning process.

### 🔒 Dynamic vs Static Entries

|**Type**|**Set By**|**Stays Permanently?**|
|---|---|---|
|Dynamic|Learned automatically|No (ages out after 5 min)|
|Static|Manually configured|Yes (stays until reboot or removed manually)|

You usually only configure **static MACs** in special security situations (e.g., port security).

### 🧾 Summary of Key Terms

|**Term**|**Full Form**|**Meaning**|
|---|---|---|
|MAC Address Table|—|A switch’s internal table mapping MACs to interfaces|
|Dynamic MAC|—|Learned automatically by the switch from incoming frames|
|Static MAC|—|Manually configured, doesn’t age out|
|Aging|—|Timeout after which unused dynamic MAC entries are removed|
|Unknown Unicast|—|Frame sent to a known IP but unknown MAC (floods all ports)|
|show mac address-table|—|Cisco command to view current MAC table|
|clear mac address-table dynamic|—|Cisco command to clear dynamic entries|
