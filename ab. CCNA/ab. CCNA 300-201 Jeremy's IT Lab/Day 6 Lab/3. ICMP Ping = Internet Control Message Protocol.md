You got it! Let’s walk through **Part 3: ICMP Ping (Echo Request & Reply)** in a chill and clear way — like you’re just explaining what “ping” actually does and how it fits into the process.

## 🧠 Part 3: ICMP Ping = **Internet Control Message Protocol**

### 🔹 What's the full story?

- **Full form**: ICMP = _Internet Control Message Protocol_
    
- **Short form**: Just “ping” — but under the hood, it’s using ICMP
    

When someone says "I pinged PC3 from PC1," what they're really doing is:

> “Hey, are you alive over there? Can you hear me?”  
> And the reply is like: “Yep, I’m here!”

That’s ICMP. It’s like a “can-you-reach-me” test — and it uses two messages:

---

### 🔸 1. ICMP Echo Request

- Sent from PC1 ➡️ to PC3
    
- It’s a **unicast** message — not broadcast, not multicast
    
- Must know PC3’s **MAC address** first (which is why ARP comes before this)
    

🧠 **Unicast** = one-to-one communication (only to PC3)

---

### 🔸 2. ICMP Echo Reply

- Sent from PC3 ➡️ back to PC1
    
- Also **unicast**, direct to PC1’s MAC address
    

So once ARP is done and PC1 has PC3’s MAC, here’s what happens:

### 🔹 Step-by-step Ping Flow

#### 🔁 One Ping Cycle:

1. **PC1 sends ICMP Echo Request**
    
    - Destination IP: `192.168.1.3`
        
    - Destination MAC: PC3’s MAC
        
    - Frame goes through SW1 → SW2 → PC3
        
2. **PC3 sends ICMP Echo Reply**
    
    - Destination IP: `192.168.1.1`
        
    - Destination MAC: PC1’s MAC
        
    - Frame goes through SW2 → SW1 → PC1
        

➡️ And this confirms: "Yes! PC3 is reachable from PC1"

### 🧪 ICMP Ping in Real Use

- On **Windows**, `ping 192.168.1.3` sends **4 pings by default**
    
- On **Cisco routers**, it sends **5 pings by default**
    

Each successful reply usually shows like this:  
✅ `Reply from 192.168.1.3: bytes=32 time=5ms TTL=128`

Or if it fails:  
❌ `Request timed out`

### 💡 Quick Analogy

- **ARP**: “What’s your MAC address?”
    
- **ICMP Ping**: “Cool, now that I know your address, can I reach you?”

|Message|Type|Who sends it|Who receives it|
|---|---|---|---|
|ICMP Echo Request|Unicast|PC1|PC3|
|ICMP Echo Reply|Unicast|PC3|PC1|
