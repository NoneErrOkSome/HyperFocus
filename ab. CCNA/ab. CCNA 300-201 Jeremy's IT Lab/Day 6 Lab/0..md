To **fully understand the lab and all the switching behavior between PC1 and PC3**, we can break it down into **six clear and connected topics** — each one explaining a piece of the process. Here's the **casual, step-by-step structure** you can follow:

---

### 🔸 **1. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**

When PC1 wants to ping PC3, it only knows **PC3’s IP address**, not its MAC address.

- So PC1 sends an **ARP Request**:
    
    - **Broadcast** message: `Destination MAC = ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff`
        
    - Sent to **every device** on the LAN
        
    - Asks: “Who has IP 192.168.1.3? Tell 192.168.1.1”
        
- Every PC receives this request:
    
    - **PC2 and PC4 ignore it** (the IP doesn't match theirs)
        
    - **PC3 replies** with an **ARP Reply**:
        
        - A **unicast** message (directly to PC1)
            
        - Contains PC3’s MAC address
            

🧠 ARP Request = **broadcast**  
🧠 ARP Reply = **unicast**

---

### 🔸 **2. MAC Address Learning (Switch Behavior)**

As the ARP Request and Reply travel through the switches:

- **Switches learn** MAC addresses dynamically:
    
    - From the **source MAC** of each frame
        
- Example:
    
    - SW1 sees PC1's MAC from F0/1 → adds to MAC table
        
    - SW2 sees PC1’s MAC from G0/1 → adds to MAC table
        
    - SW2 sees PC3’s MAC from F0/1 → adds to MAC table
        
    - SW1 sees PC3’s MAC from G0/1 → adds to MAC table
        

🧠 Switches **don’t learn** from broadcast **destination** — only from **source MACs**

---

### 🔸 **3. ICMP Ping (Echo Request/Reply)**

After the ARP process:

- PC1 now knows PC3’s MAC and sends a **unicast ICMP Echo Request**
    
    - PC3 receives it and responds with an **ICMP Echo Reply**
        

➡️ These are also **unicast** messages:

- PC1 ➡️ PC3
    
- PC3 ➡️ PC1
    

---

### 🔸 **4. MAC Address Table Commands**

After traffic has flowed:

- You can view what each switch has learned using:
    

```bash
show mac address-table
```

You’ll see:

- VLAN (usually 1)
    
- MAC Address
    
- Type (dynamic)
    
- Interface (where it was learned)
    

🧠 You can **match MACs to PCs** by looking at the **interfaces** they’re connected to.

---

### 🔸 **5. Clearing MAC Table (Manual or Timeout)**

To clear the MAC table entries manually:

```bash
clear mac address-table dynamic
```

Or with options:

```bash
clear mac address-table dynamic address <MAC>
clear mac address-table dynamic interface <interface-id>
```

🧠 Dynamic entries also **age out** after 5 minutes of inactivity.

---

### 🔸 **6. Frame Analysis (Wireshark / Packet Tracer)**

Using simulation tools like **Packet Tracer or Wireshark**, you can:

- Watch frames hop through switches
    
- View **Layer 2 info** like:
    
    - Source/Destination MAC
        
    - Type field (`0x0806` for ARP, `0x0800` for IPv4)
        
    - Broadcast vs unicast addresses
        
- See **padding bytes** added when payload < 46 bytes
    

🧠 Ethernet frames have a **minimum size** of 64 bytes, so **padding (zeroes)** is added if needed.
