Letâ€™s dive into **Part 5: Clearing the MAC Address Table** â€” in a casual and clear way, like you're just learning how to reset the switch's memory when testing or troubleshooting.

## ðŸ§  Part 5: Clearing the MAC Address Table

### ðŸ”¹ Why would you clear it?

Sometimes you want to **start fresh**, especially in labs or troubleshooting.

> Imagine a switch is like a notebook where it jots down who's connected to which port.  
> If you want it to forget everything and re-learn from scratch â€” you clear the notebook.

This is helpful when:

- Devices move to different ports
    
- You're testing learning behavior again
    
- You want to see **how the switch re-learns MACs**

### ðŸ”¸ Full form vs Short form

Thereâ€™s no fancy acronym here, but the idea is:

- **MAC Address Table** = where the switch stores learned MACs
    
- **Clear MAC Address Table** = remove all those entries (temporarily)

### ðŸ”¹ Command to clear **all dynamic** MAC addresses

```bash
clear mac address-table dynamic
```

ðŸ§  This **only clears learned (dynamic)** addresses â€” not manually configured (static) ones.

ðŸ“Œ You must be in **privileged exec mode** (`enable`) to run it.

---

### ðŸ”¸ Example:

```bash
Switch> enable
Switch# clear mac address-table dynamic
```

Then check with:

```bash
Switch# show mac address-table
```

Youâ€™ll see â€” itâ€™s empty now!

### ðŸ”¹ Can you clear just one MAC or one port?

âœ… Yes â€” _but only on real switches or in emulators like GNS3_, not in Packet Tracer.

Here are a few extra options:

|Goal|Command Example|
|---|---|
|Clear specific MAC address|`clear mac address-table dynamic address 0C2F.B06A.3900`|
|Clear entries for one interface|`clear mac address-table dynamic interface f0/1`|

ðŸ“Œ These only work on **real IOS**, not always on Packet Tracer.

---

### ðŸ§  Bonus: Aging Timer

Even if you donâ€™t manually clear the table, switches **automatically remove unused MAC entries** after about **5 minutes**.

This is called **aging** â€” so if a device goes silent, the switch eventually forgets it.

### âœ… Summary Table

|Task|Command|
|---|---|
|Clear all dynamic MACs|`clear mac address-table dynamic`|
|Clear specific MAC|`clear mac address-table dynamic address <mac>`|
|Clear MACs from one port|`clear mac address-table dynamic interface <interface>`|
|Check MAC table after|`show mac address-table`|
