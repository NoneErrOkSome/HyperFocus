Alright! Let’s go over **Part 4: MAC Address Table Commands** in a simple, casual, and clear way — like you’re learning how to look inside a switch’s memory and see who it knows.

## 🧠 Part 4: MAC Address Table = **How the switch remembers who’s who**

### 🔹 What is it?

Every switch has a **MAC address table**, also known as a **CAM table** (_Content Addressable Memory_), where it stores:

- Which **MAC address** came in through which **port**
    
- It uses this info to **forward frames directly**, instead of guessing or broadcasting
    

So how do you **see** this table?

---

### 🔸 Command to show the table

```bash
show mac address-table
```

🧠 This works in **privileged exec mode** (after you type `enable` or `en`)

---

### 🔹 What does the table show?

When you run the command, you’ll see something like this:

|VLAN|MAC Address|Type|Ports|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|0C2F.B011.9D00|dynamic|F0/1|
|1|0C2F.B06A.3900|dynamic|G0/1|

Let’s break it down:

- **VLAN**: Usually 1 unless you’re doing VLANs (don’t worry about it yet)
    
- **MAC Address**: The hardware address of a device
    
- **Type**:
    
    - `dynamic` = learned automatically
        
    - `static` = manually set (rare for now)
        
- **Ports**: Where the MAC address was learned (like F0/1 or G0/1)
    

💡 So this table tells the switch:

> “I know that MAC `9D00` lives on port F0/1, so I’ll send frames to that port if I ever see it as the destination.”

### 🔸 Use it like this:

If you're troubleshooting or verifying something in a **lab or exam**:

1. Run:
    
    ```bash
    enable
    show mac address-table
    ```
    
2. Match the MAC addresses to the **diagram**
    
    - If PC1 is connected to F0/1, then the MAC learned on F0/1 = PC1
        
    - Do this for all 4 PCs
        
3. That’s how you **identify each PC’s MAC address** using just the switch
