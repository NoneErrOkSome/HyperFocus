# üìò Ethernet LAN Switching ‚Äì Summary (Day 6 Lab & Lecture)

## üß† Part 1: ARP = Address Resolution Protocol

### What is ARP?
- **Full form**: Address Resolution Protocol  
- **Short form**: ARP  
- Used to map a **known IP address** to an **unknown MAC address** on a local network.

### How it works:
1. **PC1 sends an ARP Request**:
   - Broadcast:  
     $$ \text{Destination MAC} = ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff $$
   - Message: ‚ÄúWho has 192.168.1.3? Tell 192.168.1.1‚Äù

2. **PC3 sends an ARP Reply**:
   - Unicast back to PC1
   - Now PC1 knows PC3‚Äôs MAC address

### Summary Table

| Message       | Type      | Sent To       | Purpose                        |
|---------------|-----------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| ARP Request   | Broadcast | Everyone      | Ask: ‚ÄúWho has this IP?‚Äù        |
| ARP Reply     | Unicast   | Requester     | Answer: ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs my MAC!‚Äù       |

## üß† Part 2: Switch Learning = Dynamic MAC Learning

### How switches learn
Switches learn MAC addresses by watching the **source MAC** of incoming frames.

### Example:
- PC1 sends ARP ‚Üí SW1 learns:
  $$ \text{MAC: } 0C2F.B011.9D00 \Rightarrow \text{Port: F0/1} $$

- PC3 replies ‚Üí SW2 learns:
  $$ \text{MAC: } 0C2F.B06A.3900 \Rightarrow \text{Port: F0/1} $$

### Summary Table

| Action         | Switch Sees    | Learns What?                     |
|----------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| PC1 sends ARP  | Source MAC     | PC1's MAC on F0/1                |
| PC3 replies    | Source MAC     | PC3's MAC on F0/1 or G0/1        |

## üß† Part 3: ICMP Ping = Internet Control Message Protocol

### Ping Breakdown
- **Full form**: Internet Control Message Protocol  
- **Short form**: ICMP

### Two main messages:
1. **ICMP Echo Request** (from PC1 to PC3)
2. **ICMP Echo Reply** (from PC3 to PC1)

Both are **unicast** and require the MAC address first (thanks to ARP).

### Example:
- PC1 sends:
  $$ \text{Source IP} = 192.168.1.1 $$
  $$ \text{Destination IP} = 192.168.1.3 $$

- PC3 replies with opposite addresses

## üß† Part 4: MAC Address Table Commands

### How to view the MAC address table:

```bash
enable
show mac address-table
```

### Table fields:

| Field      | Description                       |
|------------|-----------------------------------|
| VLAN       | Virtual LAN (default = 1)         |
| MAC Addr   | Learned MAC address               |
| Type       | dynamic or static                 |
| Port       | Interface the MAC was learned on  |

---

## üß† Part 5: Clearing the MAC Address Table

### Why clear?
To reset the table and watch the switch **re-learn** addresses.

### Main command:
```bash
clear mac address-table dynamic
```

### Optional (on real switches):
```bash
clear mac address-table dynamic address <mac>
clear mac address-table dynamic interface <interface>
```

üß† MAC entries also **age out after 5 minutes** of inactivity.

## üß† Part 6: Packet Analysis (Wireshark / Simulation Mode)

### See what's inside a frame:

#### ARP Request Frame:
- Source MAC = PC1‚Äôs MAC
- Destination MAC = Broadcast  
- Type:  
  $$ \text{0x0806} \Rightarrow \text{ARP} $$

#### ICMP Frame:
- Type:  
  $$ \text{0x0800} \Rightarrow \text{IPv4} $$
- Inside: ICMP Echo Request or Reply

### Padding:
- Minimum Ethernet **payload** = 46 bytes
- If less, padding (zeros) is added  
  Example:  
  $$ 36 \text{ bytes data} + 10 \text{ bytes padding} = 46 \text{ bytes} $$

# ‚úÖ Final Notes

- ARP helps discover MAC addresses from IPs
- Switches learn MACs dynamically from **source addresses**
- ICMP Ping tests reachability with **echo request/reply**
- You can view and clear MAC tables on switches
- Packet analyzers like Wireshark let you peek under the hood
