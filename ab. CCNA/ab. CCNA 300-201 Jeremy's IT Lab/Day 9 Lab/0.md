To cover **all the details** from the Day 9 Lab transcript and the diagram (from the image you uploaded), I recommend **8 main topics**, each with fun, clear sub-parts to make it **easy to remember** and aligned with Jeremy’s hands-on approach:

---

### 💻 1. Device Setup Basics

- Set hostnames for R1, SW1, SW2
    
- Access CLI: `enable`, `conf t`, `hostname`
    

---

### 🌐 2. IP Address Configuration

- IP for R1’s G0/0 → `172.16.255.254`
    
- IPs for PCs:
    
    - PC1 → `172.16.0.1`
        
    - PC2 → `172.16.0.2`
        
    - PC3 → `172.16.0.3`
        
    - PC4 → `172.16.0.4`
        
- Subnet Mask for all: `255.255.0.0` (/16)
    
- Gateways = R1’s IP
    

---

### ⚡ 3. Speed & Duplex Settings (only between network devices)

- Set manually on G0 interfaces:
    
    - Speed → `1000`
        
    - Duplex → `full`
        
- Only required on interfaces connecting R1 ↔ SW1 ↔ SW2
    

---

### 🏷 4. Descriptions for Interfaces

- Connected interfaces:
    
    - `## to SW1 ##`, `## to SW2 ##`, `## to R1 ##`
        
    - `## to end hosts ##` for PC-facing ports
        
- Unused interfaces:
    
    - `## not in use ##`
        

---

### 🚫 5. Disable Unused Interfaces

- On **routers** → already shutdown by default
    
- On **switches** → manually shut down unused ports:
    
    - Example: `interface range f0/3 - 24`, then `shutdown`
        

---

### 🔍 6. Verification Commands

- `do show ip interface brief` (on R1)
    
- `do show interfaces status` (on SW1/SW2)
    
- Check: IPs, method (`manual`), Layer 1 (`status`), Layer 2 (`protocol`)
    

---

### 💾 7. Save Your Work

- Save configs in 3 ways (used differently on each device):
    
    - `copy running-config startup-config`
        
    - `write memory`
        
    - `write`
        

---

### 🖥 8. Final Touches: Test & Confirm

- Ping from PC1 to PC2, PC3, PC4
    
- Ensure `UP/UP` on connected ports
    
- Fix `protocol down` by matching speed/duplex across devices

### 🌟 Bonus: Easy Memory Trick

Use the acronym **HIPS-DVS** for this lab:

> **H**ostname  
> **I**P address  
> **P**ort speed/duplex  
> **S**et descriptions  
> **D**isable unused ports  
> **V**erify status  
> **S**ave configuration
