💯 You're absolutely right to bring **internet speed** into this — it plays a **huge role**, but in a different layer than encapsulation. Let's clarify exactly **how your 100kbps speed affects the whole 1GB upload**, and where **encapsulation and speed interact**.

---

## 🧠 Key Idea:

> **Encapsulation happens regardless of speed.**  
> **Speed only affects how fast frames are sent — not how they’re created.**

---

## ✅ Let’s break it down:

### 🧱 1. **Encapsulation is based on MTU, not bandwidth**

- Whether your speed is **100 Kbps** or **1 Gbps**, the data is **still broken into small chunks**:
    
    - TCP segments: ~1,460 bytes
        
    - IP packets: ~1,480 bytes
        
    - Ethernet frames: ~1,518 bytes
        

🔸 **This breakdown is fixed** by standards (MTU = ~1,500 bytes) and **network hardware**, not by your connection speed.

---

### 🚦 2. **Internet Speed = How fast those small chunks get delivered**

- With **100 Kbps** (kilobits per second), you can transmit:
    $$
    \frac{100,000 \text{ bits/sec}}{8} = 12,500 \text{ bytes/sec}
    $$
- Since each Ethernet frame is ~1,518 bytes:
    $$
    \frac{12,500}{1,518} \approx 8.2 \text{ frames per second}
	$$
⏳ **To upload 1GB = 1,073,741,824 bytes:**
$$
\frac{1,073,741,824}{12,500} \approx 85,899 \text{ seconds} \approx 23.86 \text{ hours}
$$
😵‍💫 Yes — it would take **almost a day** to upload a 1GB file at 100kbps.

---

### 🧩 3. **So what happens?**

- Your app hands 1GB to Layer 4.
    
- Layer 4 breaks it into segments.
    
- Segments → packets → frames.
    
- The NIC (Network Interface Card) **sends each frame one-by-one** over time.
    
- **Each frame waits its turn**, based on the available speed.
    

⛔ **Encapsulation happens instantly**  
⏱ **Transmission takes time** — and **this is where your speed matters**

---

## 📦 Analogy: Mail Delivery

- You have **1,000 small boxes** (frames) to send.
    
- **Encapsulation = packing the boxes** — you can pack all at once.
    
- **Internet speed = 1 box per minute** via delivery truck.
    
- If you had a faster truck (1 box per second), it finishes sooner — but **you still send 1,000 boxes** either way.

## 🎯 Bottom Line

|Action|Controlled by|Affected by Speed?|
|---|---|---|
|Encapsulation|OSI layer design (MTU)|❌ No|
|Frame transmission|Bandwidth/speed|✅ Yes|
|Total upload time|Speed + file size|✅ Yes|
