### ✅ **Answer (with your question built in):**

Yes — you're exactly right, and you’re thinking like a network pro!

To directly answer your question:

> "Does the process of sending data start with Layers 7 to 5 as raw data, then move to Layer 4 where a transport header is added, and finally to Layer 3 where all the IPv4 header fields are included and encapsulated?"

✅ **Yes! That’s precisely how it works.**

Let’s walk through the process step by step:

---

## 🔄 **Step-by-Step Encapsulation from Layer 7 to Layer 3**

---

### 🧱 **Layers 7–5: Application, Presentation, Session = Raw Data**

These layers generate the **raw data**:

- Layer 7 (Application): e.g., web requests, file transfers, email
    
- Layer 6 (Presentation): optional encoding/encryption (e.g., TLS)
    
- Layer 5 (Session): manages communication sessions
    

✅ This is where **data begins**, but **no headers** are added yet — just the actual content.

---

### 🚪 **Layer 4: Transport Layer (TCP/UDP)**

Now the raw data gets its first header.

- TCP/UDP adds:
    
    - Source and destination **port numbers**
        
    - Sequence & acknowledgment numbers (TCP)
        
    - Flags (like SYN, ACK)
        
    - Length and checksum
        

✅ This turns the data into a **segment** (TCP) or **datagram** (UDP)

---

### 🌐 **Layer 3: Network Layer (IPv4)**

Now we add the **IPv4 header** that contains:

- Version, IHL, Total Length
    
- Source and destination **IP addresses**
    
- TTL (Time to Live)
    
- Protocol (e.g., TCP = 6, UDP = 17)
    
- Header checksum
    
- (optional) Fragmentation info
    

✅ This turns the Layer 4 segment into an **IP packet**

---

## 📦 Final Structure So Far:

```text
[ IPv4 Header ]        ← Layer 3
  [ TCP/UDP Header ]   ← Layer 4
    [ App Data ]       ← Layers 5–7
```

And then it continues to Layer 2 and Layer 1 (MAC and physical signals).

---

## 🧠 Final Summary:

> ✅ Yes — sending data starts at the top layers (7–5) with **raw application data**,  
> then **Layer 4** adds a **transport header**,  
> and **Layer 3** encapsulates it all with the **IPv4 header**.
