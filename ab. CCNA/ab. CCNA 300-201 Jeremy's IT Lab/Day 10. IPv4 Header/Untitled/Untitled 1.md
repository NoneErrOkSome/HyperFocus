Does the packet keep hopping until it finds the MAC address that confirms the correct receiver? Do both the IP address and MAC address need to match at the final destination?

🎯 **BOOM — you’re right there!** But let me sharpen that answer so you know exactly how it works. This is a 🔥 key concept in networking.

---

## ✅ Your Statement (refined):

> "I will hop till it finds the MAC address that confirms the correct receiver?"

### ✅ Yes — but **each hop only finds the next-hop MAC address**, not the final receiver’s MAC.

Let’s break it down in steps.

---

## 🧠 How it really works (Hop by Hop)

### 📦 Step 1: You (the sender) have this goal:

- IP destination = `8.8.8.8` (Google DNS, for example)
    
- But you're on a home network: `192.168.1.10`
    
- Your **default gateway** is `192.168.1.1`
    

---

### 🔍 Step 2: Your PC checks:

- Is `8.8.8.8` in my subnet? ❌ No.
    
- So I must send it to the **router (default gateway)**.
    

> 🔁 **Now ARP happens** — to ask:  
> _“Who has IP 192.168.1.1?” → get router’s MAC_

Your PC now sends:

- Ethernet frame:
    
    - Source MAC = your MAC
        
    - Destination MAC = router’s MAC
        
- IP packet:
    
    - Source IP = your IP
        
    - Destination IP = 8.8.8.8
        

---

### 🚦 Step 3: Router receives it

- Router sees: “Hey, MAC matches me! Let me open this frame.”
    
- It **removes the Ethernet header (decapsulate)**
    
- Reads the **IP header**:  
    → Destination IP = 8.8.8.8
    

Router says:

> “Okay, I’ll send this to the next hop toward 8.8.8.8”

Now it does **ARP again** to get **next-hop MAC**.

Then it:

- Adds **new Ethernet frame**
    
- New source MAC = router’s MAC
    
- New destination MAC = next router’s MAC
    

And off it goes…

---

### 🔁 Step 4: This repeats at **each hop**

Each router only:

- Looks at IP header (destination IP is still 8.8.8.8)
    
- Resolves **next hop MAC**
    
- Re-encapsulates
    
- Forwards
    

---

## ✅ Final Step: The end host (8.8.8.8) receives it

Eventually, a router sends the frame to a **host** (not another router).

- The MAC address on the frame = **host’s MAC**
    
- The IP address in the packet = **host’s IP**
    

✅ Now both **IP and MAC match**

> 🎉 This host says: "Yep! I'm the destination!"  
> → **Decapsulate all the way up to the application layer**

---

## 💡 Summary:

|Layer|Must match for processing?|
|---|---|
|✅ MAC Address|Must match **locally** to open the frame|
|✅ IP Address|Must match **end-to-end** to reach the true destination|

So, you're totally right:

> ✅ **Final delivery = when MAC and IP both match the end host**

But at **every hop**, MAC keeps changing.  
Only the **final hop** uses the **real destination MAC**.
