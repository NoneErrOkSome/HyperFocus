Awesome! Here's a fun and clear **animation-style walkthrough** that shows how **IP and MAC addresses behave at each hop** as your data travels from source to destination 🚀

## 🎞️ **Animation-Style: Hop-by-Hop Data Delivery**

---

### 🎬 Scene 1: The Start — PC1 Sends Packet

🖥️ **PC1** wants to send data to `8.8.8.8` (Google DNS)

- **IP Source**: `192.168.1.10`
    
- **IP Destination**: `8.8.8.8`
    
- **MAC Source**: `AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA` (PC1's MAC)
    
- **MAC Destination**: ❓ (needs to find default gateway)
    

➡️ **PC1 does ARP** → finds MAC of default gateway = `BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB`

✅ Final Ethernet frame:

```
MAC: [AA → BB]
IP:  [192.168.1.10 → 8.8.8.8]
```

---

### 🎬 Scene 2: First Router Hop

🌐 **Router 1** receives the frame

- MAC destination = **Router 1’s MAC** → ✅ match
    
- Router strips MAC header → reads IP header
    
- Destination IP = `8.8.8.8` → not local
    

➡️ Router does ARP for **next hop router** → gets MAC = `CC:CC:CC:CC:CC:CC`

✅ New frame:

```
MAC: [BB → CC]
IP:  [192.168.1.10 → 8.8.8.8]
```

---

### 🎬 Scene 3: Second Router Hop

🌐 **Router 2** does the same:

- Sees MAC = CC → ✅ match
    
- Reads IP → still `8.8.8.8`
    
- ARPs for next hop → gets `DD:DD:DD:DD:DD:DD`
    

✅ New frame:

```
MAC: [CC → DD]
IP:  [192.168.1.10 → 8.8.8.8]
```

---

### 🔁 Scene 4–98: Repeat as needed (even up to 100 hops)

Each router:

- Decapsulates Ethernet (Layer 2)
    
- Reads IP (Layer 3)
    
- Re-encapsulates with new MACs for the **next hop**
    

🧠 **IP never changes**  
🔄 **MAC changes every hop**

---

### 🎯 Scene Final: Google Server (8.8.8.8)

🖥️ **Google's server** gets the final frame:

```
MAC: [ZZ → GG]   ← Google’s MAC
IP:  [192.168.1.10 → 8.8.8.8]
```

- ✅ MAC = server’s MAC → decapsulate
    
- ✅ IP = server’s IP → process
    
- 🎉 Now the server sends a reply!

## 🧠 Key Lessons from the Animation:

|Concept|Behavior|
|---|---|
|**IP Address**|Same from start to end (Layer 3)|
|**MAC Address**|Changes at every hop (Layer 2)|
|**ARP Usage**|At each hop to learn next MAC|
|**Final Delivery**|When IP & MAC both match at host|
