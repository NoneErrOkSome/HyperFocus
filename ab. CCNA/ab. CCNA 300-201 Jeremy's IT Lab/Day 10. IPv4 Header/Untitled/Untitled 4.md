🧠 Great question — and a very common one when learning networking!

## ✅ Rephrased Question:

> "IPv4 works at Layer 3, but does it always work **only with routers**, or can other devices use it too?"

---

## 🔥 Answer: **No — not only routers. IPv4 works with _all_ devices that use IP, not just routers.**

But routers do play a **special role** in how IPv4 works. Let me break this down:

---

## 🌐 IPv4 at Layer 3 — Who Uses It?

|Device Type|Uses IPv4?|Why?|
|---|---|---|
|🖥️ PCs & laptops|✅ Yes|To communicate with other hosts across networks|
|📱 Phones & tablets|✅ Yes|Same reason — every internet-connected device has an IP|
|🖨️ Printers|✅ Yes|For remote printing over networks|
|📦 Switches|❌ Not usually|Layer 2 devices — use MAC addresses instead|
|🌐 Routers|✅ Absolutely|Key devices that **route IPv4 packets between networks**|

---

## 🚦 What’s the Router’s Special Role?

Routers are **Layer 3 devices**. Their job is to:

- **Read the IPv4 header**
    
- Check the **destination IP address**
    
- Decide the **next hop**
    
- Forward the packet toward its final destination
    

So:

> ✅ Routers are **required** if a packet needs to travel **between different networks**

But:

> ❌ **IPv4 is not exclusive to routers** — every end device needs IPv4 to communicate.

---

## 💡 Summary

- ✅ **IPv4 works at Layer 3**
    
- ✅ **Routers are essential** for delivering packets **across networks**
    
- ❌ **Routers are not the only devices** that use IPv4
    
- ✅ **Every device** with a network interface and IP address uses IPv4
