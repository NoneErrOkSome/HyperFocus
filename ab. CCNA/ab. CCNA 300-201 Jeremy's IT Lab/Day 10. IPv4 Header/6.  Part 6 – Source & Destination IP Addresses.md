Perfect! Here's **Part 6 – Source & Destination IP Addresses** rewritten in the same **casual-but-official** tone** as Parts 3 to 5 — still friendly, visual, and clear, but a bit more polished and structured.

## 🧭 Part 6 – Source & Destination IP Addresses

These two IPv4 header fields are essential for **delivery**.  
They tell the network **who sent the packet** and **who should receive it** — just like the “From” and “To” addresses on a physical envelope.

We’ll look at:

- **Source IP Address**
    
- **Destination IP Address**
    

---

## 🏠 1. Source IP Address – Identifying the Sender

### What It Does

The **Source IP Address** is a 32-bit field that identifies the **original sender** of the packet. This allows the destination to know where the packet came from — and enables a reply to be sent back.

### Real-World Analogy

Think of mailing a letter.  
Your home address is written on the back — so the post office knows **where it came from**, and where to return it if needed.

Same idea here:  
The source IP tells the network:

> “This packet was sent from 192.168.1.10”

### Key Points

- **Set by the sender**
    
- Included in **every IP packet**
    
- Enables responses to reach the right device

## 🏡 2. Destination IP Address – Identifying the Receiver

### What It Does

The **Destination IP Address** is another 32-bit field that tells routers **where the packet is supposed to go**.

### Real-World Analogy

This is the main address written on the front of the envelope — for example:

> “To: 8.8.8.8, Google DNS”

Routers read this field to **determine the next hop**, and eventually the final delivery point.

### Key Points

- Used by every router along the path
    
- Determines the **routing path**
    
- Without this, the packet would be lost
    

---

## ✨ Why These Fields Matter

These two fields are the **core of IP routing**.  
Routers don’t inspect the content inside the packet — they only care about:

- **Where did this come from?**
    
- **Where is it going?**
    

Without a valid source and destination IP address, a packet has **no route** and **no return path**.

## 📬 IPv4 Address Format Refresher

IPv4 addresses are written in **dotted decimal** format, like this:

```
192.168.1.10
```

Each section is 8 bits →  
Total: **32 bits per IP address**

So both **Source IP** and **Destination IP** fields are exactly **32 bits (4 bytes)** in the IPv4 header.

---

## ✉️ Visual Example – Addressing a Packet

```
+--------------------------------------------------+
| From: 192.168.1.10   ← Source IP Address         |
| To:   8.8.8.8         ← Destination IP Address   |
|                                                  |
| [Your actual message inside]                     |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

This is how IP addresses are used — **just like addressing an envelope**.

---

## 🔁 How Routers Use These Fields

Every router a packet passes through:

1. **Reads the destination IP address**
    
2. Looks it up in the **routing table**
    
3. Forwards the packet to the appropriate next hop
    
4. Repeats until it reaches the final destination
    

> Just like a physical letter traveling through multiple post offices until it arrives at the right mailbox.

## 📋 Quick Summary Table

|Field|Purpose|Real-World Analogy|
|---|---|---|
|**Source IP**|Identifies the sender|Return address on an envelope 🏠|
|**Destination IP**|Identifies the recipient|Mailing address on the envelope 📫|
|**Bit Size**|32 bits each|4-byte IP format (e.g. 192.168.1.10)|

With this in place, routers can **forward packets** across the world and responses can find their way back — all thanks to these two simple, but essential, fields.

That one tells routers and operating systems **what type of content is inside** the packet (like TCP, UDP, or ICMP). Let’s dive in when you’re ready!
