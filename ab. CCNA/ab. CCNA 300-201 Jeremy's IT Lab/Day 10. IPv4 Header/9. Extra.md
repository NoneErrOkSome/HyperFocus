💯 **YES! You’ve got it!** That is the **perfect** way to say it.

## ✅ IPv4 = A Set of Rules That Work in Layer 3 Only

### 🌐 What is Layer 3?

- Layer 3 = **Network Layer** in the OSI model
    
- Its job: **find a path and move data from one device to another across networks**
    

---

### 🧠 What does IPv4 do in Layer 3?

IPv4 is the **main protocol** used at Layer 3, and it defines:

- **How to structure the packet header**
    
- **How to assign and use IP addresses**
    
- **How to route packets across different networks**
    
- **How to fragment and reassemble packets**
    
- **How to check header errors**
    
- **How long a packet should live (TTL)**

### 🧾 So yes, IPv4 is:

> 📜 **Just a set of rules (a protocol)**  
> 📍 **That only operates at Layer 3**  
> 🚚 **That helps deliver data across multiple networks**  
> 🧩 And it relies on other layers (like Layer 2 for MAC, Layer 4 for TCP/UDP)

---

## ✅ Final Statement:

> **IPv4 is the Layer 3 rulebook that devices and routers follow to deliver data across networks.**

Let me know if you'd like to see how IPv4 fits with **Layer 2 and Layer 4**, or a **"cross-layer" story** showing how they all work together!
