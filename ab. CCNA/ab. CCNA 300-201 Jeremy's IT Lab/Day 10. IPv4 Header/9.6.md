Awesome — let’s break down the journey of a **1GB file** from Layer 7 to Layer 2, showing **how it's divided step by step** at each OSI layer, like zooming in from a big shipping container down to tiny parcels.

## 📦 Sending a 1GB File: **OSI Layer-by-Layer Breakdown**

> Let's say you're uploading a **1GB video file** to Google Drive. Here’s what happens:

---

### 🧠 **Layer 7 – Application (e.g., Browser or Drive App)**

- You select a file: **1GB = 1,073,741,824 bytes**
    
- The application begins **streaming the file** in chunks, not all at once.
    
- It passes data to Layer 6 and Layer 5 — these layers might compress, encrypt, or structure it (if needed), but they **don’t break it into small packets**.
    

🔸 **File still = 1GB (logically)**  
🔽 Passed down to Layer 4

---

### 📮 **Layer 4 – Transport (TCP)**

- TCP takes the 1GB stream and **splits it into segments**.
    
- Each **TCP segment** can hold around **1,460 bytes** of actual data **(based on typical MTU of 1,500 bytes)**.
    

Let’s calculate:

Number of segments=1,073,741,8241,460≈735,438 TCP segments\text{Number of segments} = \frac{1,073,741,824}{1,460} \approx 735,438 \text{ TCP segments}

🧱 Each segment gets:

- TCP Header (20 bytes typical)
    
- Sequence number, port number, etc.
    

🔽 Each segment is now passed to Layer 3

---

### 🌐 **Layer 3 – Network (IPv4)**

- TCP segments become **payloads inside IPv4 packets**.
    
- Each packet gets an **IP header (20 bytes)**.
    
- Total size of an IP packet = **1,480 bytes** (20 IP + 1,460 TCP)
    

⛔ IP packets are **limited to 65,535 bytes**, but real networks obey MTU (~1,500), so fragmentation rarely happens here — it’s **already segmented properly by TCP**.

🔽 Passed to Layer 2

---

### 🧬 **Layer 2 – Data Link (Ethernet)**

- IP packets are encapsulated into **Ethernet frames**.
    
- Each frame adds:
    
    - **Ethernet header (14 bytes)**
        
    - **Ethernet trailer (FCS, 4 bytes)**
        
    - Total: **18 bytes of Ethernet overhead**
        

🚚 These frames are sent **one-by-one** over the physical medium.

---

### 🧮 **Grand Total – How Many Frames?**

Assuming each frame carries 1,460 bytes of payload (same as TCP segment):

- **Total frames sent = ~735,438**
    
- Each frame is **1,518 bytes** (Ethernet header + IP header + TCP header + data + FCS)

## 📊 Visualization Summary

|OSI Layer|Unit|Size per Unit|Count for 1GB|
|---|---|---|---|
|7–5|App Layer Stream|1GB|1|
|4|TCP Segment|~1,460 bytes|~735,438|
|3|IP Packet|~1,480 bytes|~735,438|
|2|Ethernet Frame|~1,518 bytes|~735,438|

### 🎯 Analogy: Moving a House Brick-by-Brick

- **Layer 7**: The full house (1GB file)
    
- **Layer 4**: Breaks it into bricks (segments)
    
- **Layer 3**: Sticks an address label on each brick
    
- **Layer 2**: Wraps it in bubble wrap and loads it on a delivery truck (Ethernet)
