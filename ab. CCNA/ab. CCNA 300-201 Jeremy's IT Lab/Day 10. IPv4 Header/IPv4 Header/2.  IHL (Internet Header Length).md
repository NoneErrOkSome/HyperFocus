## 🧠 IPv4 Header – IHL (Internet Header Length)  
**Size: 4 bits**

---

### ✅ What is it?

- **IHL** stands for **Internet Header Length**.
- It tells how long the **IPv4 header** is — not the whole packet, just the header.
- Since the header can vary in size (due to optional fields), IHL helps routers know **where the header ends and the data begins**.

---

### 📐 What does it measure?

- The IHL value is measured in **32-bit words** (4 bytes per word).

$$
\text{IHL value} \times 4 = \text{IPv4 header length in bytes}
$$

---

### 📊 Valid IHL Range

- Since it's a 4-bit field, the IHL value ranges from:

$$
0001_2 = 1 \quad \text{to} \quad 1111_2 = 15
$$

- So the actual IPv4 header size can range from:

$$
1 \times 4 = 4\ \text{bytes (invalid, too short)} \quad \text{to} \quad 15 \times 4 = 60\ \text{bytes (maximum)}
$$

- But the **minimum legal IHL value** is:

$$
5 \times 4 = 20\ \text{bytes (standard header, no options)}
$$

### 🎯 Purpose of IHL

Routers and receiving hosts use the IHL to:

- Determine the size of the IPv4 header
- Locate where the **payload (Layer 4 segment)** begins
- Know how much to process or skip when parsing

---

### 🧪 When would the header be longer than 20 bytes?

When IPv4 **Options** are used (rare today), they’re appended after the standard 20-byte fields.

In that case:

- IHL increases accordingly (e.g., $IHL = 6$ means $6 \times 4 = 24$ bytes)
- Devices **must respect the IHL** so they don’t confuse options with payload

### 📍 Where is it located?

It’s in **Byte 0**, right after the 4-bit Version field:



Byte 0: | xxxx | xxxx | | Ver | IHL |

### ✅ Summary Table

| Property        | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Name            | Internet Header Length (IHL) |
| Size            | 4 bits |
| Unit            | 32-bit words (4 bytes) |
| Valid Values    | 5 to 15 (→ 20 to 60 bytes) |
| Default         | 5 (→ 20 bytes, no options) |
| Purpose         | Tells how long the IPv4 header is |
| Needed For      | Finding where the **payload begins** |
