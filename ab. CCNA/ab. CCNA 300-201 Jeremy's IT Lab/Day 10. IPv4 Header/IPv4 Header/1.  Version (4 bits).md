Absolutely! Let’s **deep dive into the `Version` field (4 bits)** of the IPv4 header — just this one field, explained clearly and thoroughly 👇

## 🧠 IPv4 Header – **Version (4 bits)**

### ✅ **What is it?**

- A **4-bit field** located at the **very beginning** of the IPv4 header.
    
- Its binary value tells the receiving device **which version of IP** is being used.
    
- In IPv4, this value is always:
    
$$\text{Version} = 4$$

- That means the 4 bits are:
    

```
0100 (binary)
```

---

### 🎯 **Purpose**

- To **identify the format of the IP header** so that the receiving device can **interpret the rest of the fields correctly**.
    
- It tells routers, firewalls, and endpoints:
    
    > "Hey, this is an IPv4 packet — process me using IPv4 rules."
    

---

### 🧩 **Why it's necessary**

- There are **multiple versions of IP**:
    
    - IPv4 (Version = 4)
        
    - IPv6 (Version = 6)
        
    - Others existed in early research (e.g., version 5 = experimental ST protocol)
        

Since each IP version has a **different header structure**, this field is essential to **avoid confusion**.

### 📥 **Where is it located?**

It’s the **first 4 bits** of the IPv4 header:

```
Byte 0:  | 0100 | xxxx |
         | Ver  | IHL  |
```

---

### 🛡️ **What happens if it’s wrong or modified?**

- If a router receives a packet with an **invalid or unexpected version**, it will **drop the packet** or reject it.
    
- If a device expects IPv6 but sees Version = 4, it won’t try to parse it — saving CPU and avoiding errors.

### ✅ **Summary**

|Property|Value|
|---|---|
|Size|4 bits|
|Purpose|Identify the IP version (IPv4 = `4`)|
|Required for|Correct parsing of the rest of the header|
|Common Values|`4` for IPv4, `6` for IPv6|
|Location|First 4 bits of the IP header (Byte 0)|
