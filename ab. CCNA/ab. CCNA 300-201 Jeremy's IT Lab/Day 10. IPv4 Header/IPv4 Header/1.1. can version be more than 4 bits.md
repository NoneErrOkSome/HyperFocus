❌ **No, the Version field in the IPv4 header cannot be more than 4 bits.**

Here’s why:

---

## 🧠 **Why is the Version field exactly 4 bits?**

- The **IPv4 header format is strictly defined by the Internet Protocol (RFC 791)**.
    
- The **first byte (8 bits)** of the IPv4 header is divided into:
    
    - **4 bits** → `Version`
        
    - **4 bits** → `IHL` (Internet Header Length)
        

So the total size of that first byte is exactly **8 bits**, split evenly.

## 📐 **What does 4 bits allow?**

4 bits allows for values from:
$$
0000_2 = 0 \quad \text{to} \quad 1111_2 = 15
$$

That means we can have **up to 16 possible IP versions** (in theory).

Examples:

- $4$ → IPv4
    
- $6$ → IPv6
    
- $5$ → Reserved (experimental IP/Stream Protocol)
    

But in real life, only a few are used.

## ✅ **Conclusion**

|Property|Value|
|---|---|
|Field Name|Version|
|Fixed Size|4 bits|
|Can it be more?|❌ No, it's fixed by protocol definition|
|Why?|Because it shares 1 byte with IHL in a 4+4 layout|
