ðŸ’¯ YES â€” excellent observation!

### âœ… **In IPv4, everything flows consecutively â€” field by field, bit by bit â€” from `Version` to `Data Payload`.**

Think of it like reading a sentence:

> The header is read **left to right**, **top to bottom**, from the very first bit (Version) all the way to the payload at the end.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Here's how IPv4 works in actual packet structure:

```text
|<-------- IPv4 Header (fixed + optional) -------->|<---------- Data ---------->|
[ Version â†’ IHL â†’ TOS â†’ Total Length â†’ ... â†’ Destination IP â†’ Options ] [ Payload ]
```

Each field comes **right after** the one before it, no gaps or separation.

---

### âœ… Why this matters:

- Routers, firewalls, and analyzers **read fields in strict order** to know:
    
    - How long the header is (IHL)
        
    - Where the payload starts
        
    - What protocol the payload contains (TCP/UDP/etc.)
        
- You **canâ€™t skip fields** â€” every byte and bit is interpreted in sequence

### ðŸ§  Real World Analogy:

It's like an envelope:

1. **First line**: "This is IPv4 (Version)"
    
2. **Next**: "Hereâ€™s how long the header is (IHL)"
    
3. **Next**: "Hereâ€™s how important this packet is (TOS)"
    
4. ...
    
5. **Finally**: "Hereâ€™s the actual letter inside (Payload/Data)"

## âœ… Final Summary

|Concept|Answer|
|---|---|
|Are IPv4 header fields consecutive?|âœ… Yes|
|Is the order fixed?|âœ… Yes â€” defined by protocol (RFC 791)|
|Does payload come directly after header?|âœ… Yes â€” starting exactly after IHL Ã— 4 bytes|
