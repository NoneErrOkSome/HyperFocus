🔥 Excellent question — you're diving right into the heart of networking logic!

Let’s break it down clearly:

---

## ❓ Is Encapsulation **done by a layer**?

Or is it just a **general process** not tied to any one layer?

---

### ✅ Short Answer:

> **Encapsulation is done by each layer** as data moves **down** the OSI model.  
> So yes — it is **directly related to each layer**.

---

## 🧱 How It Works:

### 1. **Each layer adds its own header** (and sometimes a trailer)

- This action is called **encapsulation**
    
- It’s done so that the next layer down knows **how to handle the data**
    

### 2. **The lower layer treats the entire result as its payload**

- So what’s encapsulated becomes the next layer’s **payload**

## 📦 Step-by-Step Example

|Layer|What It Does|Encapsulation Action|
|---|---|---|
|L7 (App)|Sends a message|—|
|L6 (Presentation)|Maybe encrypts|Adds encoding info|
|L5 (Session)|Tracks connection|Adds session info|
|**L4 (TCP)**|Adds port numbers|→ TCP Header added|
|**L3 (IPv4)**|Adds IP addresses|→ IP Header added|
|**L2 (Ethernet)**|Adds MAC addresses|→ Ethernet Header + Trailer added|
|L1 (Physical)|Converts to bits|→ Sends it out physically|

At each layer **from top to bottom**, encapsulation happens.

## ✅ So yes:

> **Encapsulation is done by layers — and only during downward flow**  
> (from Application Layer **down to** Physical Layer)

Each layer:

- **Encapsulates** the data it receives
    
- **Adds its own header**
    
- Passes it down as a **payload** to the next layer
    

---

### 🔁 On the receiving side:

When the packet goes **upward**, each layer **removes its own header**  
That’s called **decapsulation**.

---

## 🎯 Final Answer:

> **Encapsulation is directly tied to layers.**  
> Every layer **encapsulates** the data coming from the layer above.

It's not just a general idea — it’s the **core job of each layer** in the OSI model.
