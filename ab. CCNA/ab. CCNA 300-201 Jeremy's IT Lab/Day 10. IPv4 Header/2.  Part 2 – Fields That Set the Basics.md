Awesome! Let’s get into **Part 2 – Fields That Set the Basics** 🧾  
We’ll cover 3 super important labels on your "shipping envelope":  
**Version**, **IHL**, and **Total Length**.

---

## ✉️ 1. **Version** – What kind of label is this?

### 📘 What it is:

This just tells the router what type of **IP protocol** is being used.

### 💬 In real life:

Think of it like writing **“Air Mail” vs “Express”** on a package.  
It tells the post office _how_ to handle the envelope.

### 💡 Value in IPv4:

Always `4` → because we’re using **IP version 4**  
In binary: `0100`

- IPv6 would be `6` → `0110`
    

> 🧠 You don’t even have to think too hard about this — just remember:  
> **IPv4 = Version 4 = 0100**

## 📏 2. **IHL (Internet Header Length)** – How long is the label?

### 📘 What it is:

This tells the router how long the IPv4 header is.  
But here’s the twist → It’s measured in **4-byte chunks**.

### 💬 In real life:

Imagine the post office scans your shipping label to know where each sticker or code is.  
If you have a **basic label**, it’s short (20 bytes).  
If you added **extras**, like tracking or customs forms, the label is longer (up to 60 bytes).

### 🧮 How it works:

- IHL is a 4-bit field
    
- Each unit = 4 bytes
    
- So,
    
    - Value `5` = 5 × 4 = **20 bytes** (minimum)
        
    - Value `15` = 15 × 4 = **60 bytes** (maximum)
        

> 🧠 In most cases, **IHL = 5 → header is 20 bytes** long  
> That means: “no special options, just a regular envelope.”

## 📦 3. **Total Length** – How big is the entire package?

### 📘 What it is:

It shows the total size of the whole IP packet:

- IPv4 header **+** the data (like TCP segment or whatever’s inside)
    

### 💬 In real life:

This is the **weight** or total size of the package being delivered.

### 🧮 Details:

- It’s a 16-bit field = can go up to **65,535 bytes**
    
- Minimum = **20 bytes** (header only, no data)
    
- Max = **65,535 bytes** (that’s a BIG packet!)
    

> 🔧 The router uses this to know how much to forward, and also helps in breaking the packet into fragments if it’s too big for the network.

## 🎯 Quick Summary Table

|Field|What it Does|Real Life Analogy|Common Values|
|---|---|---|---|
|Version|IPv4 or IPv6|“Air Mail” or “Express” label|IPv4 = `4` (0100)|
|IHL|Length of IPv4 header|Size of the label|Usually 5 → 20 bytes|
|Total Length|Size of header + data|Full weight of the package|20 to 65,535 bytes|
