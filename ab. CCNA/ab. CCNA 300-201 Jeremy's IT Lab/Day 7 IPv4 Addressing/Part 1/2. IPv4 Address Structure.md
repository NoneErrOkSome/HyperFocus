# ðŸ”¢ Part 2: IPv4 Address Structure

## ðŸ§± IPv4 is a 32-bit Address

An IPv4 address is composed of **32 bits**, split into **4 octets** (8 bits each). For human readability, we use **dotted decimal notation**, like:


192.168.1.254


Each number in this format is one **octet** and ranges from **0 to 255**.

## ðŸ“Œ Binary Representation

Each octet can be shown in **binary** (base-2), which uses only `0` and `1`.

For example:

- `192` in binary = `11000000`
- `168` in binary = `10101000`
- `1` in binary = `00000001`
- `254` in binary = `11111110`

So, the full binary for `192.168.1.254` is:



11000000.10101000.00000001.11111110



This equals a full 32-bit IPv4 address.

## ðŸ’¡ Why Use Dotted Decimal?

Binary is hard to read for humans, so we convert IP addresses into **dotted decimal format** for easier understanding and configuration.

### ðŸ§  Quick Comparison

| Format       | Example                    |
|--------------|-----------------------------|
| Binary       | `11000000.10101000.00000001.11111110` |
| Dotted Decimal | `192.168.1.254`             |

## ðŸ”„ Decimal Range

Since each octet is 8 bits, the possible decimal values range from:

$$
2^0 = 1 \quad \text{to} \quad 2^8 - 1 = 255
$$

So each octet ranges from:

$$
0 \text{ (00000000)} \quad \text{to} \quad 255 \text{ (11111111)}
$$

That gives us:

- Minimum IPv4 address: `0.0.0.0`
- Maximum IPv4 address: `255.255.255.255`

## ðŸ§® Octet Breakdown

Let's break this down using powers of 2:

| Bit Position | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
|--------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Power of 2   | 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |

If a bit is `1`, you include that value. For example:



Binary: 10101100 â†’ 128 + 32 + 8 + 4 = 172



So `10101100` in binary is `172` in decimal.

## ðŸ§  Summary

- IPv4 addresses are 32-bit values divided into **4 octets**.
- Each octet is 8 bits and ranges from **0 to 255**.
- Binary is used internally, but we read and write IP addresses in **dotted decimal**.
