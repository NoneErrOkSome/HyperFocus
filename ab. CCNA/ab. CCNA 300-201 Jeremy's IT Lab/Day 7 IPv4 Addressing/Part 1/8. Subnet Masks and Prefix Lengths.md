# ðŸ§® Part 8: Subnet Masks and Prefix Lengths

To determine how many bits of an IP address are used for the **network** vs. the **host**, we use either:

1. A **prefix length** (e.g., `/24`)
    
2. A **subnet mask** in **dotted decimal** (e.g., `255.255.255.0`)
    

Both methods tell us the **same thing**, just in different formats.

## ðŸ”¢ Prefix Length (Slash Notation)

- Indicates how many bits are used for the **network**.
    
- Example:  
    `/24` means the **first 24 bits** are the network portion.
    

IPv4 has **32 bits**, so:

32âˆ’24=8Â bitsÂ forÂ host32 - 24 = 8 \text{ bits for host}

## ðŸ“˜ Subnet Mask (Dotted Decimal Notation)

Each `255` in the subnet mask represents **8 network bits** (all 1s in binary).

|Prefix|Subnet Mask|Binary|
|---|---|---|
|/8|255.0.0.0|11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000|
|/16|255.255.0.0|11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000|
|/24|255.255.255.0|11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000|

## ðŸ§  Equivalence Examples

|CIDR Notation|Subnet Mask|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|`192.168.1.10/24`|`255.255.255.0`|24 bits for network, 8 bits for hosts|
|`10.0.0.5/8`|`255.0.0.0`|8 bits for network, 24 bits for hosts|
|`172.16.50.33/16`|`255.255.0.0`|16 bits for network, 16 bits for hosts|

Both styles are used in the networking world:

- **Cisco** tends to use **dotted decimal masks**
    
- **Juniper** and modern practice often prefer **CIDR slash format**
    

---

## ðŸ§  Summary

- **Prefix length** (`/24`) = number of bits used for the **network** portion.
    
- **Subnet mask** (`255.255.255.0`) = same info, just in dotted decimal format.
    
- Both tell the router how to split the IP into **network** vs **host**.
