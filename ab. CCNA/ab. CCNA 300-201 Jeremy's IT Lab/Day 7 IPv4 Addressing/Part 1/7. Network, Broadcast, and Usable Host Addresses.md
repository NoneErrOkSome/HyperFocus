# 🌐 Part 7: Network, Broadcast, and Usable Host Addresses

Every IPv4 subnet has three important types of addresses:

1. **Network address** – identifies the **network itself**
    
2. **Broadcast address** – used to **send to all hosts** in the network
    
3. **Usable host addresses** – IPs that can be **assigned to devices**
    

Let’s break them down.

---

## 🏁 1. Network Address

- This is the **first IP** in the subnet.
    
- The **host portion is all 0s**.
    
- Used to **identify the subnet**, not a specific device.
    
- **Cannot** be assigned to any host.
    

### Example:

For `192.168.1.0/24`, the binary looks like:

```
Network: 192.168.1 → 11000000.10101000.00000001
Host:    0         → 00000000
```

So the network address is:

**192.168.1.0**

---

## 📢 2. Broadcast Address

- This is the **last IP** in the subnet.
    
- The **host portion is all 1s**.
    
- Used to send messages to **every host** in the subnet.
    
- **Cannot** be assigned to a host.
    

### Example:

For `192.168.1.0/24`, the binary:

```
Network: 192.168.1 → 11000000.10101000.00000001
Host:    255       → 11111111
```

So the broadcast address is:

**192.168.1.255**

---

## 🧑‍💻 3. Usable Host Addresses

- All addresses **between** the network and broadcast addresses.
    
- These can be **assigned to hosts**, like PCs, routers, printers.
    

### Example:

In a `/24` subnet:

- Network: `192.168.1.0`
    
- Broadcast: `192.168.1.255`
    
- Usable range: `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.254`
    

There are:

28−2=254 usable host addresses2^8 - 2 = 254 \text{ usable host addresses}

> Subtract 2: one for network, one for broadcast.

## 🧠 Summary

|Address Type|Description|Bits in Host Portion|
|---|---|---|
|Network Address|All 0s in host portion|`00000000`|
|Broadcast Address|All 1s in host portion|`11111111`|
|Usable Host|Any value between 0 and 255, excluding both|varies|

**Important rule:** You cannot assign the **network** or **broadcast** address to any device. Only the IPs in between are usable.
