# üåç Part 5: Network vs Host Portions of an IP

An IPv4 address isn‚Äôt just a single flat number. It‚Äôs actually **split into two parts**:

- The **network portion** ‚Äî tells you _which network_ the device is on.
    
- The **host portion** ‚Äî identifies _the specific device_ (host) on that network.
    

This separation is key to how routers direct traffic.

## üß© How Do You Know the Split?

You use the **prefix length** (also called a "subnet mask") to define where the break is between the network and host portions.

Example:  
`192.168.1.254/24`  
That **/24** means:

- First 24 bits = **network portion**
    
- Last 8 bits = **host portion**
    

Because IPv4 is 32 bits long, that leaves:

$$
32 - 24 = 8 \text{ bits for the host}
$$

## üß† Visual Breakdown of `/24`

### IPv4 Address:
**Decimal:**  
`192.168.1.254`  

**Binary:**  
```
11000000 . 10101000 . 00000001 . 11111110
   192       168        1           254
```

---

### Subnet Mask: `/24`  
This means the **first 24 bits** (3 octets) belong to the **network**, and the **last 8 bits** (1 octet) are for the **host**.

```
Network Portion ‚Üí  11000000 . 10101000 . 00000001
                   (192)      (168)      (1)

Host Portion    ‚Üí                             11111110
                                               (254)
```

---

### üß© Summary:
- **/24 subnet** = 255.255.255.0
- **Network address:** `192.168.1.0`
- **Host part in this IP:** `254`

## üßÆ Other Prefix Lengths

|Prefix|Network Bits|Host Bits|Example IP|Meaning|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|/8|8|24|`12.128.251.23/8`|Network = `12`, Host = `128.251.23`|
|/16|16|16|`154.78.111.32/16`|Network = `154.78`, Host = `111.32`|
|/24|24|8|`192.168.1.254/24`|Network = `192.168.1`, Host = `254`|

---

## üîé Example Recap

- **192.168.1.0/24**
    
    - `192.168.1` = **network portion**
        
    - `0` = **host portion**
        
- **192.168.2.1/24**
    
    - `192.168.2` = **network**
        
    - `1` = **host**
        

---

## üß† Summary

- The **prefix length** (e.g. `/24`) tells you how many bits are used for the **network** portion.
    
- The **remaining bits** are for the **host**.
    
- Devices in the same network share the **same network portion** of their IP address.
    
- This concept is **essential for routing**, because routers forward based on the **network portion**.
