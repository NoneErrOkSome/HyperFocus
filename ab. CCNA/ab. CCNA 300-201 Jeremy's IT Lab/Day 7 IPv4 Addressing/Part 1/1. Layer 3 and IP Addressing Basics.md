# 🧠 Layer 3 and IP Addressing Basics

## 📍 OSI Model Context

We're moving from **Layer 2: Data Link** to **Layer 3: Network Layer**.

- Layer 2 (e.g., Ethernet) uses **MAC addresses**
  - MAC addresses are **burned into** the hardware.
- Layer 3 (e.g., IP) uses **IP addresses**
  - IP addresses are **assigned manually** or automatically (e.g., via DHCP).
  
## 🌐 What Does Layer 3 Do?

- Provides **connectivity between different networks** (inter-network communication).
- Enables communication from one **LAN** to another, e.g., PC1 in one LAN → PC3 in another.
- Introduces the concept of **logical addressing**.
- Provides **path selection**: chooses the best path through a complex network (e.g., Internet).
  
## 🚦 Key Role: Routers

- Operate at **Layer 3**.
- **Forward packets** between networks based on IP addresses.
- Act as a **boundary** between LANs.

## 🧩 Key Difference from Layer 2

| Feature           | Layer 2                     | Layer 3                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Address Type      | MAC Address                 | IP Address               |
| Format Example    | `0C2F.B011.9D00`             | `192.168.1.1`            |
| Address Scope     | Local to the LAN            | Global across networks   |
| Device Example    | Switch                      | Router                   |

## 🧠 Summary

- IP addressing lives at **Layer 3** of the OSI model.
- It enables **end-to-end communication** between devices on **different** LANs.
- **Routers** are needed to **route traffic** based on IP addresses.
