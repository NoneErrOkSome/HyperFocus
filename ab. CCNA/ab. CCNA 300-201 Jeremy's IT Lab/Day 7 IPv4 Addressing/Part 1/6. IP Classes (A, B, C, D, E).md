# 🏷 Part 6: IP Classes (A, B, C, D, E)

Before subnetting was widely used, IPv4 addresses were grouped into **classes** to define how many networks and hosts you could have. This system is known as **classful addressing**, and while it’s mostly historical now, it’s still important for understanding how IP addressing evolved.

---

## 🅰️ Class A

- **First bit starts with 0**
    
- **First octet range:** `0` to `127`
    
- **Default subnet mask:** `/8` → 8 bits for network, 24 bits for host
    

### Example:

- `12.128.251.23` → Class A
    
- Network: `12`
    
- Host: `128.251.23`
    

### Capacity:

- **2⁷ = 128** possible networks (but 127 is reserved)
    
- **2²⁴ - 2 = 16,777,214** usable hosts per network
    

> ⚠️ IPs starting with `127.x.x.x` are **reserved** for loopback testing (more on that soon).

## 🅱️ Class B

- **First bits:** `10`
    
- **First octet range:** `128` to `191`
    
- **Default subnet mask:** `/16` → 16 bits for network, 16 bits for host
    

### Example:

- `154.78.111.32` → Class B
    
- Network: `154.78`
    
- Host: `111.32`
    

### Capacity:

- **2¹⁴ = 16,384** possible networks
    
- **2¹⁶ - 2 = 65,534** usable hosts per network

## 🅲 Class C

- **First bits:** `110`
    
- **First octet range:** `192` to `223`
    
- **Default subnet mask:** `/24` → 24 bits for network, 8 bits for host
    

### Example:

- `192.168.1.254` → Class C
    
- Network: `192.168.1`
    
- Host: `254`
    

### Capacity:

- **2²¹ ≈ 2 million** networks
    
- **2⁸ - 2 = 254** usable hosts per network
    

---

## 🅳 Class D (Multicast)

- **First bits:** `1110`
    
- **First octet range:** `224` to `239`
    
- Used for **multicast groups**, not regular devices.
    

---

## 🅴 Class E (Experimental)

- **First bits:** `1111`
    
- **First octet range:** `240` to `255`
    
- Reserved for **future use**, not assigned to devices.
    

---

## 🔁 Loopback Range

- Any IP with **first octet `127`** is for **loopback testing**:
    
    - `127.0.0.1` is the most well-known.
        
    - Used to test your own TCP/IP stack.
        

### Example:

If you `ping 127.0.0.1`, the device **pings itself** without sending packets out.

|Class|First Octet Range|Prefix|Use|Hosts per Network|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|A|0–127 (0xxxxxxx)|/8|Few networks, many hosts|~16 million|

|D|224–239|N/A|Multicast|N/A|
|E|240–255|N/A|Experimental|N/A|
