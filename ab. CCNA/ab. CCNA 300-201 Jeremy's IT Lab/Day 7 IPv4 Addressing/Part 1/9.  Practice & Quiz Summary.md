# 📘 Part 9: Practice & Quiz Summary

The final section of the video focused on **hands-on practice** converting between binary and dotted decimal IPv4 addresses. The goal is to make you comfortable moving between the two formats effortlessly.

## 🧠 Practice Focus

There were **10 questions** split into two sections:

### 🔁 Part 1: Convert Binary → Decimal (Dotted Notation)

You were given a **32-bit binary string**, and asked to:

1. **Split it into four 8-bit octets**
    
2. **Convert each octet from binary to decimal**
    
3. **Reconstruct the IPv4 address**
    

#### Example:

```
Binary: 00111111.00111000.11100111.00010011
→ Decimal: 63.56.231.19
```

### 🔁 Part 2: Convert Decimal → Binary

You were given a standard IPv4 address (e.g. `88.46.90.91`) and asked to:

1. Convert **each decimal octet to binary**
    
2. Combine to get a 32-bit address in binary format
    

#### Example:

```
Decimal: 221.234.246.163
→ Binary:
  11011101.11101010.11110110.10100011
```

## 🧮 Binary Conversion Tips

### Binary to Decimal:

- Use the place values:  
    `128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1`
    
- Add up the positions where there's a `1`
    

### Decimal to Binary:

- Subtract the highest possible place value and write `1`
    
- Write `0` for skipped values
    
- Example:  
    `207` → subtract `128`, then `64`, skip `32`, and so on  
    Result: `11001111`

## 📌 Binary Range Reminder

Each octet (8 bits) can represent:

28=256 values: 0 to 2552^8 = 256 \text{ values: } 0 \text{ to } 255

- Lowest possible value: `00000000` = `0`
    
- Highest possible value: `11111111` = `255`
    

This is why each IP octet ranges from `0–255`.
