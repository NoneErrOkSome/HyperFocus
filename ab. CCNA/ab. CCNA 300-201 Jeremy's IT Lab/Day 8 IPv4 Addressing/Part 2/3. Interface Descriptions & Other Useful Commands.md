Got it! Here's **Part 3** of the summary for **Day 8 ‚Äì IPv4 Addressing (Part 2)** in regular Markdown with raw LaTeX for math:

## üìé Topic 6: Interface Descriptions & Other Useful Commands

### Add Descriptions to Interfaces

You can label interfaces to show what they connect to. This helps with clarity in larger networks.

**Command to set a description:**

```
description #Connected to PC1
```

**Shortcut also works:**

```
desc #Connected to PC1
```

Then use:

```
show interfaces description
```

This shows:

- Interface
    
- Status
    
- Protocol
    
- Description
    

Descriptions are optional but **very useful** when managing real networks.

### More Useful "show" Commands

1. `show ip interface brief`
    
    - Summarized status of all interfaces.
        
2. `show interfaces`
    
    - Detailed Layer 1 and Layer 2 info (includes MAC address, IP, speed, duplex, etc).
        
3. `show interfaces g0/0`
    
    - Detailed info for a specific interface.
        
4. `show mac address-table` _(used on switches)_
    
    - Shows which MAC addresses are learned and on which ports.

## ‚ùì Topic 7: Quiz Breakdown Strategy

At the end of the video, Jeremy gives 5 IP address questions. Here‚Äôs how to approach each:

### Step-by-Step:

**Given:**

- IP address  
- Prefix (e.g., /8, /16, /24)

**Find:**

1. **Network Address** ‚Äì Set all host bits to 0  
2. **Broadcast Address** ‚Äì Set all host bits to 1  
3. **Max Hosts** ‚Äì Use formula:

   $$
   2^h - 2
   $$

4. **First Usable** ‚Äì Network Address + 1  
5. **Last Usable** ‚Äì Broadcast Address - 1


---
### üß™ Example:

**Given:** `43.109.23.12/8`

- Class A ‚Üí 8 network bits ‚Üí 24 host bits

  $$
  2^{24} - 2 = 16,777,214
  $$

- **Network Address**: `43.0.0.0`  
- **Broadcast Address**: `43.255.255.255`  
- **First Usable Address**: `43.0.0.1`  
- **Last Usable Address**: `43.255.255.254`


---

Repeat this logic for each quiz IP and subnet. Always break down:

- What‚Äôs the prefix length?
    
- How many host bits?
    
- Apply the formula and assign ranges.
