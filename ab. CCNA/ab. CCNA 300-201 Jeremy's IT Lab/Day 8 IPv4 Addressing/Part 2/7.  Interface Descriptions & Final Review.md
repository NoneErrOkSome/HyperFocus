## üè∑Ô∏è Topic 9: Interface Descriptions & Final Review

### ‚úçÔ∏è Setting Interface Descriptions

You can add custom labels to router/switch interfaces to describe what they connect to. This is helpful for documentation and troubleshooting.

**Command:**

```
interface g0/0
description #Connected to PC1
```

**Shortcut version:**

```
int g0/1
desc #Connected to PC2
```

You can write any description you want, e.g.:

- `# Uplink to Switch`
    
- `# Internet Connection`
    
- `# Backup Router`
    

Then view it with:

```
show interfaces description
```

This will show a table with:

|Interface|Status|Protocol|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|G0/0|up|up|#Connected to PC1|
|G0/1|up|up|#Connected to PC2|
|G0/2|up|up|#Connected to PC3|

Descriptions are **optional** but very **practical** in real environments.
