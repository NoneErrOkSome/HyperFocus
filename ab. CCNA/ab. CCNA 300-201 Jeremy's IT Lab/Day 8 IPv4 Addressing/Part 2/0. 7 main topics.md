To fully cover the details from **Jeremy’s IT Lab Day 8 – IPv4 Addressing Part 2**, I recommend breaking the content down into **7 clear and casual topics**, each focused on one concept at a time. Here's how I’d structure it:

---

### 🧠 **Topic 1: Quick Review of IPv4 Classes**

- Class A: 0.0.0.0 – 127.255.255.255 (but 0 and 127 are reserved)
    
- Class B: 128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255
    
- Class C: 192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255
    
- Class D & E: Special-use
    
- Leading bits and prefix lengths:
    
    - A: `0xxxxxxx` → /8
        
    - B: `10xxxxxx` → /16
        
    - C: `110xxxxx` → /24
        

---
### 🔢 **Topic 2: Max Number of Usable Hosts**

- **Formula**:

  $$
  2^h - 2
  $$

  where \( h \) = number of **host bits**

---

- **Examples**:

  - **Class A** (24 host bits):  
    $$
    2^{24} - 2 = 16,777,214
    $$

  - **Class B** (16 host bits):  
    $$
    2^{16} - 2 = 65,534
    $$

  - **Class C** (8 host bits):  
    $$
    2^8 - 2 = 254
    $$


---

### 🌐 **Topic 3: Network, Broadcast, First & Last Usable Address**

- Network Address: All host bits = 0
    
- Broadcast Address: All host bits = 1
    
- First usable: Network + 1
    
- Last usable: Broadcast - 1
    
- Example (/24):
    
    - Network: `192.168.1.0`
        
    - Broadcast: `192.168.1.255`
        
    - Usable: `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.254`
        

---

### ⚙️ **Topic 4: Configuring IP Addresses on Cisco Routers**

- Use `interface` config mode: `int g0/0`
    
- Assign IP: `ip address 10.255.255.254 255.0.0.0`
    
- Enable interface: `no shutdown`
    
- Shortcut versions accepted: `int`, `g0/0`, `ip add`
    

---

### 📋 **Topic 5: Verifying Interface Status**

- Command: `show ip interface brief`
    
- Columns:
    
    - **Interface**: Name like `g0/0`
        
    - **IP-Address**: Current assigned IP
        
    - **OK?**: Legacy, usually ‘YES’
        
    - **Method**: Manual, DHCP, etc.
        
    - **Status**: Layer 1 (e.g., up/down)
        
    - **Protocol**: Layer 2 (e.g., up/down)
        

---

### 📎 **Topic 6: Descriptions & Other Show Commands**

- Add description: `description #Connected to PC1`
    
- Check with: `show interfaces description`
    
- Other useful show commands:
    
    - `show interfaces`
        
    - `show mac address-table` (on switches)
        

---
### ❓ **Topic 7: Practice Quiz Walkthrough**

- **Given**: IP address and prefix → calculate:

  - Network address  
  - Maximum number of hosts:
  
    $$
    2^h - 2
    $$

  - Broadcast address  
  - First and last usable addresses

---

- **Examples**:

  - **/8** →  
    $$
    2^{24} - 2 = 16,777,214
    $$

  - **/16** →  
    $$
    2^{16} - 2 = 65,534
    $$

  - **/24** →  
    $$
    2^8 - 2 = 254
    $$
