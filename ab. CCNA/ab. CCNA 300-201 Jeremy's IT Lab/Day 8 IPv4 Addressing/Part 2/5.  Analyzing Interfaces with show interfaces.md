Here‚Äôs **Part 5**, the final part of the summary for **Day 8 ‚Äì IPv4 Addressing Part 2**, covering interface analysis, MAC address info, description config, and final quiz tips.

## üîç Topic 10: Analyzing Interfaces with `show interfaces`

### Command:

```
show interfaces g0/0
```

This gives **detailed Layer 1 and Layer 2 information**, such as:

- Interface status (up/down)
    
- Line protocol status
    
- Hardware type (e.g., 1GBE)
    
- **MAC address** (also called **BIA** ‚Äì Burned-In Address)
    
- Internet address (assigned IP)
    
- MTU, bandwidth, errors, etc.
    

### MAC Address Notes:

- **BIA** = Burned-In Address = factory MAC address
    
- Even though you _can_ configure a different MAC manually, it‚Äôs rare

## üè∑Ô∏è Topic 11: Configuring Interface Descriptions

### Command:

```
interface g0/0
description #Connected to PC1
```

Or shortened:

```
int g0/1
desc #Connected to PC2
```

Then use:

```
show interfaces description
```

You‚Äôll see a clean table with:

- Interface names
    
- Status
    
- Protocol
    
- Descriptions (if configured)
    

Descriptions are super helpful when troubleshooting or documenting networks.

## üìö Topic 12: Final Review & Quiz Focus

### What you should be able to do now:

1. Identify IPv4 class ranges and prefix lengths

2. Calculate:

   - Network address  
   - Broadcast address  
   - First and last usable addresses  
   - Maximum hosts with:

     $$
     2^h - 2
     $$

3. Configure IPs on router interfaces using:

   - `interface`, `ip address`, `no shutdown`

4. Verify with:

   - `show ip interface brief`  
   - `show interfaces`  
   - `show interfaces description`

## üß† Quiz Strategy Recap

For any quiz question:

- **Given:** IP address and prefix (e.g. `155.200.201.141/16`)

- **Find:**

  1. **Network Address** ‚Üí host bits = 0  
  2. **Broadcast Address** ‚Üí host bits = 1  
  3. **Maximum Hosts**:

     $$
     2^{32 - \text{prefix}} - 2
     $$

  4. **First Usable** ‚Üí Network Address + 1  
  5. **Last Usable** ‚Üí Broadcast Address - 1

Practice makes this super quick and intuitive.
