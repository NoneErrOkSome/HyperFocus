Here’s **Part 2** of the summary for **Day 8 – IPv4 Addressing Part 2**, continuing in **Markdown with raw LaTeX** formatting for Obsidian or Markdown-based notes:

## 🧩 Topic 3: Network, Broadcast, First & Last Usable Addresses

### 🧠 Definitions:

- **Network Address**: All host bits = 0  
- **Broadcast Address**: All host bits = 1  
- **First Usable Address**: Network + 1  
- **Last Usable Address**: Broadcast - 1  

---

### 🧮 Examples:

#### Class C – 192.168.1.0/24  
- Host bits: 8  
- Total addresses:  
  $$
  2^8 = 256
  $$  
- Usable:  
  $$
  2^8 - 2 = 254
  $$  
- Addresses:  
  - Network: 192.168.1.0  
  - Broadcast: 192.168.1.255  
  - First usable: 192.168.1.1  
  - Last usable: 192.168.1.254

---

#### Class B – 172.16.0.0/16  
- Host bits: 16  
- Usable:  
  $$
  2^{16} - 2 = 65,534
  $$  
- Network: 172.16.0.0  
- Broadcast: 172.16.255.255  
- Usable range: 172.16.0.1 – 172.16.255.254

---

#### Class A – 10.0.0.0/8  
- Host bits: 24  
- Usable:  
  $$
  2^{24} - 2 = 16,777,214
  $$  
- Network: 10.0.0.0  
- Broadcast: 10.255.255.255  
- Usable range: 10.0.0.1 – 10.255.255.254

## ⚙️ Topic 4: Configuring IP Addresses on Cisco Routers

### 🔧 Basic Commands (Interface Mode):





```bash
enable
configure terminal
interface g0/0
ip address 10.255.255.254 255.0.0.0
no shutdown
````

- `no shutdown` brings interface up (enabled).
    
- Use full or shortcut versions:
    
    - `interface gigabitethernet0/0` → `int g0/0`
        
    - `ip address` → `ip add`
        
    - `no shutdown` → `no shut`
        

---

### 📋 Topic 5: Checking Interface Status – Layer 1 and Layer 2

#### Command:

```bash
show ip interface brief
```

|Field|Meaning|
|---|---|
|Interface|Interface name (e.g., G0/0)|
|IP Address|Assigned IP or `unassigned`|
|OK?|Legacy check for validity|
|Method|How IP was assigned (manual, DHCP, etc.)|
|Status|Layer 1 (Physical) – `up` or `down`|
|Protocol|Layer 2 (Data link) – `up` or `down`|

🧠 **Note**:

- Default on Cisco routers: interfaces are **administratively down** (shutdown).
    
- After enabling (`no shutdown`), both Status and Protocol should become **up**.
