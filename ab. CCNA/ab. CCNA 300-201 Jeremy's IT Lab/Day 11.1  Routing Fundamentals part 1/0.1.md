Let’s explain the routing concept in Jeremy’s CCNA Day 11 (Part 1) video, using the provided image as our focus.

### 🧭 **What Is Routing?**

Routing is the process routers use to **forward packets** to the correct destination. Unlike switches (which use MAC addresses), routers use **IP addresses** to forward traffic to remote networks.

### 🔍 **Using the Image: Understanding Routing Table Entries**

From the image you provided, we can break down the routing table on a Cisco router:

|Code|Meaning|Destination Network|Interface|
|---|---|---|---|
|C|Connected route|192.168.13.0/24|GigabitEthernet0/0|
|L|Local route|192.168.13.1/32|GigabitEthernet0/0|
|C|Connected route|192.168.12.0/24|GigabitEthernet0/1|
|L|Local route|192.168.12.1/32|GigabitEthernet0/1|
|C|Connected route|192.168.1.0/24|GigabitEthernet0/2|
|L|Local route|192.168.1.1/32|GigabitEthernet0/2|

### 🧠 **What’s the Difference Between “C” and “L”?**

- **C = Connected Route**  
    This means the router is connected to the **entire network**, not just one host.  
    Example:
    
    - `192.168.1.0/24` means **any IP** from `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.254`
        
    - Router will **forward packets** to this network.
        
- **L = Local Route**  
    This is for the **router’s own interface IP**.  
    Example:
    
    - `192.168.1.1/32` means **exactly one IP**, used by the router itself.
        
    - Router will **receive** packets addressed to this IP.

### 🎯 **How Routing Decision Works**

When a packet arrives, the router:

1. **Looks for matching routes**.
    
2. **Chooses the most specific route** (longest prefix length).
    

**Example:**  
If a packet is destined for `192.168.1.1`:

- It matches both `192.168.1.0/24` **and** `192.168.1.1/32`
    
- But **/32 is more specific** than /24, so the router **receives the packet itself**.

### 🧨 **What If No Match?**

If the router **can’t find any matching route**, it will **drop the packet**.  
Unlike switches (which might flood frames), **routers never flood packets**.

---

### 🧾 **Summary Based on the Image**

- **Each interface = 2 routes** in the routing table:
    
    - **Connected route (C)** to the network
        
    - **Local route (L)** to the router’s own IP
        
- **C routes** are used to forward packets to directly connected networks.
    
- **L routes** are used when the router is the destination.
    
- The router selects the **most specific match** (longest subnet mask).
    

Let me know if you’d like a Markdown + LaTeX version for notes or further breakdowns (like routing decisions in binary).
