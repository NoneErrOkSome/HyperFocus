Here’s **Part 4** of Jeremy’s IT Lab – **Day 11 (Part 1): Routing Fundamentals**, in the same casually clear and structured tone. This part walks through **route selection examples**, emphasizing what “most specific” really means in practice.

## 🧪 Part 4 – Route Selection Examples (What “Most Specific” Really Means)

---

### 🎯 Reminder: What Does “Most Specific” Mean?

It’s the route with the **longest prefix length** that still **matches** the destination IP.

|Prefix|IP Range it Covers|Specific?|
|---|---|---|
|`/24`|Covers 256 IPs (e.g. `.0`–`.255`)|Less specific|
|`/32`|Covers only 1 IP (e.g. `.1` only)|Most specific|

---

### ✅ Example 1: Packet to `192.168.1.1`

Routing Table:

```
C    192.168.1.0/24 is directly connected, Gig0/2  
L    192.168.1.1/32 is directly connected, Gig0/2
```

- Both routes match.
    
- **Winner:** `L 192.168.1.1/32` – it's the most specific.
    
- 📥 Router receives the packet for itself.

### ✅ Example 2: Packet to `192.168.13.3`

Routing Table includes:

```
C    192.168.13.0/24 is directly connected, Gig0/0
```

- Only one match: the connected route to `.13.0/24`.
    
- 📤 Router forwards the packet **out of Gig0/0**.

### ✅ Example 3: Packet to `192.168.1.244`

Routing Table includes:

```
C    192.168.1.0/24 is directly connected, Gig0/2
```

- IP `1.244` is inside the `/24` range.
    
- ✅ Matches the connected route.
    
- 📤 Router sends it out of **Gig0/2**.
    

---

### ✅ Example 4: Packet to `192.168.12.1`

Routing Table includes:

```
L    192.168.12.1/32 is directly connected, Gig0/X
```

- Match is a **local route**.
    
- 📥 Router keeps the packet for itself.
    

---

### ❌ Example 5: Packet to `192.168.4.10`

Routing Table:

- No route to `192.168.4.0/24`
    
- ❌ No match at all
    
- 🛑 Router **drops** the packet.
    
- No broadcast, no flooding.

### 🧠 Recap of Route Selection

|Packet Destination|Match Type|Action|
|---|---|---|
|`.1.1`|Both C and L|Use **L** (more specific)|
|`.13.3`|C only|Forward via **Gig0/0**|
|`.1.244`|C only|Forward via **Gig0/2**|
|`.12.1`|L only|**Receive** (for router)|
|`.4.10`|None|**Drop** the packet|
