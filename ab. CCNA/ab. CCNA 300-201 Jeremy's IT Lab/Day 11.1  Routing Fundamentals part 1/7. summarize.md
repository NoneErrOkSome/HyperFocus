Here’s a clean summary of the **key details** from _Day 11 (Part 1) – Routing Fundamentals_ from Jeremy’s IT Lab:

## 🔑 Key Notes – Routing Fundamentals (Day 11 Part 1)

### 📌 What is Routing?

- Routing = process routers use to forward IP packets to their destination.
    
- Routers use a **routing table**, just like switches use a MAC address table.
    
- Routing methods:
    
    - **Dynamic Routing** (e.g. OSPF)
        
    - **Static Routing** (manual config)
        
    - **Automatic routes** (Connected & Local)

### 📌 What is a Route?

- A **route** tells the router:  
    _“To reach destination X, send the packet to next-hop Y or out interface Z.”_
    
- Three possible actions:
    
    1. Forward to next-hop (another router)
        
    2. Forward directly (destination is in connected network)
        
    3. Keep the packet (destination is the router’s own IP)

### 📌 Automatic Routes (when IP is configured & interface is up)

- **C = Connected route**  
    → Route to the entire network/subnet the interface is in  
    → e.g. `192.168.1.0/24`
    
- **L = Local route**  
    → Route to the exact IP address on the interface  
    → e.g. `192.168.1.1/32`
    

---

### 📌 Route Matching

- A route matches a packet if the destination IP is in that route’s network.
    
- **Multiple matches?**  
    → Router picks the **most specific match** (longest prefix)
    

#### Example:

- Packet to `192.168.1.1`
    
    - Matches both `/24` and `/32`
        
    - Router uses `/32` (Local route → keep the packet)
        

---

### 📌 No Match?

- If no route matches, **router drops the packet**
    
- Routers **do not flood** like switches
    

---

### 📌 Practice Examples

|Packet Destination|Action|
|---|---|
|`192.168.1.1`|Match `/32` → **Receive it (Local)**|
|`192.168.13.3`|Match `/24` → **Forward (Connected)**|
|`192.168.1.244`|Match `/24` → **Forward (Connected)**|
|`192.168.12.1`|Match `/32` → **Receive it (Local)**|
|`192.168.4.10`|No match → **Drop the packet**|

### 📌 Summary Statements in `show ip route`

- Lines like `1.0/24 is variably subnetted, 2 subnets, 2 masks` are **not actual routes**.
    
- Just informational, showing:
    
    - 2 subnets exist within a broader Class A network
        
    - Using two different masks (`/24` and `/32`)

### 📌 Quiz Review Highlights

- Configuring IP on interface adds:
    
    - ✅ `C` (Connected)
        
    - ✅ `L` (Local)
        
- Routers:
    
    - ✅ Drop unknown destinations
        
    - ❌ Never flood like switches
        
- Longest prefix wins in route selection:
    
    - `/32` is more specific than `/24`
