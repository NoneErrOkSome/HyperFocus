Here’s **Part 2** of Jeremy’s IT Lab – **Day 11 (Part 1): Routing Fundamentals**, written casually and clearly but still serious and detailed. This part focuses on the **Connected and Local routes**, including what they mean, how they work, and how to read them.

## 🔗 Part 2 – Connected & Local Routes (Codes C & L)

---

### 🛠️ How Are Routes Added Automatically?

When you:

- **Assign an IP address** to a router interface
    
- And **enable** it with `no shutdown`
    

Cisco IOS **automatically adds two routes** to the routing table for **each interface**:

1. **Connected Route (C)**
    
2. **Local Route (L)**
    

These aren’t dynamic or static—they’re **just automatic**.

---

### 📘 1. Connected Route (Code: C)

This is a route to the **entire subnet/network** that the interface is connected to.

💡 Example:  
If G0/2 on R1 is configured with `192.168.1.1/24`, the connected route will be:

```
C    192.168.1.0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/2
```

This route means:

> “If you want to send a packet to any host in the 192.168.1.0/24 network, send it out of interface G0/2.”

It covers all IPs from:

```
192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255
```

---

### 📗 2. Local Route (Code: L)

This is a route to the **exact IP address** configured on the router’s interface.

💡 Continuing the example above:

```
L    192.168.1.1/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/2
```

This route means:

> “If a packet is sent to 192.168.1.1 (the router’s own address), **keep it**. This packet is for me.”

Note:

- **/32** means all 32 bits are locked in — it matches only **that one IP**, nothing else.

### 📊 Route Summary per Interface

Every interface gets:

|Route Type|CIDR|What it Covers|What the Router Does|
|---|---|---|---|
|Connected|e.g. /24|Whole subnet (e.g. 192.168.1.0/24)|Sends packet out of that interface|
|Local|/32|Just the interface’s IP|Keeps the packet for itself (no forwarding)|

---

### 🧪 Why Does This Matter?

Let’s say R1 has:

- A connected route to `192.168.1.0/24`
    
- A local route to `192.168.1.1/32`
    

Then a packet arrives destined for `192.168.1.1`.

Both routes match, but which one wins?

✅ The **local route** wins, because it’s **more specific** (longer prefix length: /32 vs /24).  
📥 R1 receives the packet — it does **not** forward it.

---

### 🧠 Little Rule to Remember:

> If multiple routes match, **longest prefix (most specific)** wins.

In our case:

- `192.168.1.0/24` → matches 256 addresses
    
- `192.168.1.1/32` → matches only one address (more specific)
