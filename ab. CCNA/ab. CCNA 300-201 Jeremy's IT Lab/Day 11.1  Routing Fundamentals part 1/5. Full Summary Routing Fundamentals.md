Here’s **Part 5** of Jeremy’s IT Lab – **Day 11 (Part 1): Routing Fundamentals**, presented as a full summary slide in a casually clear but serious tone. This captures all major concepts from the video in a single, structured review.

## 🧾 Part 5 – Full Summary: Routing Fundamentals (Review Slide Breakdown)

---

### 🧠 What Is Routing?

- **Routing** is the process routers use to decide **where to send packets** based on their **IP destination address**.
    
- Routers use a **routing table** — a set of instructions for how to reach known networks.

### 📜 Types of Routes

When you **configure and enable** an IP address on a router interface, **two routes** are added automatically:

|Code|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`C`|**Connected**|Route to the **entire subnet** of the interface|
|`L`|**Local**|Route to the **exact IP address** on the interface|

> Example:  
> If R1’s G0/2 = `192.168.1.1/24`  
> Then:
> 
> - `C 192.168.1.0/24` (covers 256 addresses)
>     
> - `L 192.168.1.1/32` (covers 1 IP only)
>     

---

### 🎯 Matching a Route

A route **matches** a packet if the destination IP falls inside the route’s IP network range.

Examples:

- Packet to `192.168.1.2` matches `192.168.1.0/24`
    
- Packet to `192.168.1.1` matches both `/24` and `/32`
    

---

### 🏆 Route Selection Rule

If **multiple routes match**, the router picks the one with the **longest prefix** (most specific match):

|Route|Prefix|Specific?|
|---|---|---|
|`/32` (Local)|Most specific (1 IP) ✅||
|`/24` (Connected)|Less specific (256 IPs) ❌||

🔁 So a packet for `192.168.1.1` is handled by the **Local route**, not the Connected route.

---

### ❌ No Match = Drop the Packet

If **no route** matches the destination IP:

- The router **drops** the packet.
    
- Unlike switches, **routers never flood**.

### 🔄 Summary Table

|Action|Router Behavior|
|---|---|
|IP address configured & enabled|Adds `C` (Connected) and `L` (Local) routes|
|Match found (only 1)|Uses that route|
|Multiple matches|Chooses **most specific** route|
|No matches|Drops the packet|
