Here are **6 full topics** from **Day 11 (Part 1)** of Jeremy’s IT Lab – **Routing Fundamentals**, each explained **casually but clearly**, keeping a serious tone. I've included all short form expansions like _L = Local_ and _C = Connected_.

## 🛣️ 1. What Is Routing?

Routing is how routers **decide the best path** for IP packets to reach their destination. While switches use **MAC address tables** to forward frames in a LAN, **routers use routing tables** to forward IP packets across different networks.

- Routers look at the **destination IP** and pick the best **route** from their routing table.
    
- A **route** is simply an instruction:  
    _“If you want to reach network X, send the packet to next-hop Y (or send it out of interface Z).”_
    

There are two main methods routers use to learn routes:

- **Dynamic Routing** – Routers share routing info automatically (e.g., with OSPF).
    
- **Static Routing** – Routes are entered manually by a network engineer.
    

But there's also a third category: **automatically generated routes**, which leads us to...

## 🔗 2. Connected and Local Routes (Route Types: C & L)

When you configure an IP address on a router interface and **enable it** with `no shutdown`, the router automatically adds **two types of routes**:

- **C – Connected Route**:  
    A route to the **network** the interface is directly connected to (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`).
    
- **L – Local Route**:  
    A route to the **exact IP address** configured on the router’s interface (e.g., `192.168.1.1/32`).
    

💡 Example: If R1 has IP `192.168.1.1/24` on G0/2, these two routes appear:

- `C 192.168.1.0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/2`
    
- `L 192.168.1.1/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/2`

## 🧠 3. How to Read the Routing Table

Command:

```bash
show ip route
```

You’ll see:

- A list of **codes** (L, C, S, D, O...) — what kind of route it is
    
- A list of **routes**, with destinations, prefixes, and outgoing interfaces
    

**C = Connected**,  
**L = Local**,  
**S = Static**,  
**O = OSPF**, etc.

Example output:

```
C    192.168.1.0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/2  
L    192.168.1.1/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/2
```

## 🔍 4. Matching Routes and Route Selection

A **route matches** if the **destination IP** is inside the **network** specified in the route.

- If **multiple routes match**, the router chooses the **most specific route**, meaning the route with the **longest prefix** (largest subnet mask).
    

💡 Example: For a destination `192.168.1.1`, both of these match:

- `192.168.1.0/24` (covers 256 addresses)
    
- `192.168.1.1/32` (only that one IP)
    

✅ Router will use `192.168.1.1/32` (Local route)  
⛔ Not `192.168.1.0/24` (Connected route)

---

## 📥 5. What Happens If There’s No Match?

If a router doesn’t find any matching route:

- It **drops the packet**.
    
- Routers **never flood** packets like switches do.
    

So a packet to `192.168.4.10` — if R1 doesn’t have a route to that network — gets dropped.

## 📚 6. Summary of Routing Fundamentals

- Routers use a **routing table** to decide where to send IP packets.
    
- **Connected (C)** and **Local (L)** routes are added automatically when you configure an interface.
    
- Routing tables contain **instructions** on how to reach destinations.
    
- Routers pick the **most specific matching route** (longest prefix).
    
- If no route matches, the router **drops** the packet.
    
- Unlike switches, routers don’t flood.  
    They forward only based on **specific routing decisions**.
