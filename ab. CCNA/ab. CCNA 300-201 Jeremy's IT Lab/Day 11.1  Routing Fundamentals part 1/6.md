## 🧪 Part 6 – Quiz Review & Explanations

---

### ✅ **Question 1**

**The IP address configured on a router interface will appear in the routing table as what kind of route?**

🅰️ A. Static  
🅱️ B. Connected  
✅ **C. Local**  
🅳 D. Dynamic

**Answer: C – Local**

- When you configure an IP address and enable the interface:
    
    - `L` (Local) route is added for that **exact IP address**
        
    - `C` (Connected) route is added for the **whole subnet**
        
- So the IP **itself** appears as a **Local** route.

### ✅ **Question 2**

**What will R1 do when it receives a packet destined for `192.168.3.25`?**  
(Assume R1 has a local route to `192.168.3.25/32`.)

🅰️ A. Forward it  
✅ **B. Receive it**  
🅲 C. Drop it  
🅳 D. Flood it

**Answer: B – Receive it**

- The `/32` local route means that address is **R1’s own**.
    
- So the router **keeps** the packet and doesn’t forward it.

### ✅ **Question 3**

**Which of these statements about routers and switches are true? (Select 2)**

🅰️ A. Routers flood unknown packets  
✅ **B. Switches flood frames with unknown destination**  
✅ **C. Routers drop packets with unknown destination**  
🅳 D. Switches drop unknown unicast frames

**Answer: B and C**

- Switches flood **unknown unicast** and **broadcast** frames.
    
- Routers **never flood** — they just **drop packets** with unknown destinations.

### ✅ **Question 4**

**Which two types of routes are automatically added when you configure and enable an interface?**

✅ **A. C and L**  
🅱️ B. S and D  
🅲 C. O and S  
🅳 D. D and L

**Answer: A – C and L**

- `C = Connected`
    
- `L = Local`  
    → Both added **automatically** when the interface is configured and enabled.

### ✅ **Question 5**

**If R1 receives a packet destined for `10.0.1.23`, and has both of these routes:**

- `10.0.1.0/24`
    
- `10.0.1.23/32`
    

**How many routes match, and which one is used?**

🅰️ A. One match, `/24`  
🅱️ B. One match, `/32`  
✅ **C. Two matches, `/32` is most specific**  
🅳 D. Two matches, `/24` is most specific

**Answer: C – Two matches, `/32` is most specific**

- Both routes **match** the destination.
    
- `/32` matches **only** `.23`, making it **more specific** than `/24`.

### 📘 Final Tip:

If you're ever unsure in these questions, just remember:

> **Most Specific Wins. No Match = Drop.**
