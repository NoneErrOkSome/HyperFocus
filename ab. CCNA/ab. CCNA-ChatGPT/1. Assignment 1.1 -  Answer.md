Excellent. You've completed **Assignment 1.1**, and your results show that you're already thinking like a network tech. Here's your project report breakdown:

---

## âœ… **Assignment 1.1 â€“ Two PC Direct Connection**

### ðŸ§ª What You Did:

- Used a **crossover cable** between PC0 and PC1.
    
- Assigned:
    
    - PC0: `192.168.1.1`
        
    - PC1: `192.168.1.2`
        
- Successfully **pinged** from PC0 to PC1.
    

### ðŸ“˜ **What You Learned:**

---

### 1. ðŸ“¡ **Direct Communication Requires IP and Cable**

- Two end devices can **communicate directly** if:
    
    - They are on the **same subnet** (e.g., `/24`).
        
    - A proper cable (crossover) is used.
        

---

### 2. ðŸ§  **Ping Confirms Layer 3 Reachability**

- `ping` is your basic tool to test if one host can reach another at the **IP level** (Layer 3).
    
- A successful ping means:
    
    - **Link is physically up**
        
    - **MAC address was resolved via ARP**
        
    - **Both IPs are correctly configured**
        

---

### 3. ðŸ§± **Adding a Third Host Exceeds Direct Cabling**

- You couldnâ€™t ping PC3 because:
    
    - PCs only have **one network interface**.
        
    - Direct PC-to-PC connections can only scale to **two** hosts.
        
    - Thereâ€™s **no central point** to share communication with others.
        

---

### ðŸ§© Realization:

> ðŸ‘‰ You now understand why a **switch** is required to connect **more than 2 devices** into a single LAN.

## ðŸ”œ Next Assignment?

Would you like to move on to **Assignment 2: Switching Basics**, where youâ€™ll:

- Connect multiple PCs through a **Layer 2 switch**
    
- Observe how a switch **learns MAC addresses**
    
- Use the `show mac address-table` command like a real network tech?
    

Say the word, and Iâ€™ll assign it like your next work ticket.
