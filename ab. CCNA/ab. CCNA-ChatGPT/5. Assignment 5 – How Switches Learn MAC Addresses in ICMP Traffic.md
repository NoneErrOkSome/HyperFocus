# 🧾 Assignment 5 – **How Switches Learn MAC Addresses in ICMP Traffic**

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

Understand **how and when switches learn MAC addresses** by analyzing **ICMP (ping)** traffic. You’ll learn what triggers MAC learning, what “dynamic” means in the MAC address table, and how a switch builds, maintains, and ages this table based on **source MAC addresses** in real-time.

---

## 🧠 **Why This Matters**

A switch is a **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)** device. It doesn’t understand IP addresses — it forwards frames based on **MAC addresses**.

However, a switch doesn’t come with MAC info preloaded. It builds a **MAC address table dynamically** by watching the **source MAC address** of incoming Ethernet frames.

This lesson teaches:

- When and how MAC addresses are added to the switch
    
- What causes entries to be removed (aging or manual clearing)
    
- How ping traffic helps the switch learn devices

## 🧰 **What You’ll Use**

Your same topology:

- **PC0: 192.168.1.1**
    
- **PC1: 192.168.1.2**
    
- **PC2: 192.168.1.3**
    
- **SW1 (Cisco 2960 Layer 2 switch)**
    

---

## ✅ **What You’ll Do**

---

### 🔧 Step 1 – Start Fresh

1. On the switch:
    

```bash
SW1# clear mac address-table dynamic
SW1# show mac address-table
```

✅ You should see an empty table (or very minimal output).

2. On all PCs:
    

```bash
arp -d
```

---

### 🔍 Step 2 – Go Into Simulation Mode

1. Switch to **Simulation Mode**.
    
2. Edit Filters → check:
    
    - **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)** ✅
        
    - **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)** ✅
        

---

### 🧪 Step 3 – Trigger MAC Learning via Ping

On **PC0**, run:

```bash
ping 192.168.1.3
```

Step through the traffic using **“Capture/Forward”**.

---

## 🔬 What to Observe

---

### 🟡 **ARP Request** (Broadcast)

- Destination MAC = FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
    
- **Switch floods the frame**
    
- **Switch learns PC0’s MAC** on the port it came from
    

✅ **Why**: Switch always learns **source MAC** of any incoming frame.

---

### 🟢 **ARP Reply** (Unicast)

- Destination MAC = PC0’s MAC
    
- Source MAC = PC2’s MAC
    
- **Switch learns PC2’s MAC**
    

✅ **Why**: ARP reply is also a frame — switch sees the **source MAC** of PC2 and records it.

---

### 🔵 **ICMP Echo Request + Reply**

- Echo Request: from PC0 to PC2
    
- Echo Reply: from PC2 to PC0
    
- **Switch learns both source MACs if it hasn't already**
    

✅ **Each frame is an opportunity for learning the source MAC**.

---

### 📄 Step 4 – Confirm the MAC Table

Back on the switch:

```bash
SW1# show mac address-table
```

✅ You should now see 2 or 3 entries:

```
VLAN    MAC Address       Type        Ports
----    -----------       --------    -----
1       aabb.cc00.0101    DYNAMIC     Fa0/1
1       aabb.cc00.0102    DYNAMIC     Fa0/2
1       aabb.cc00.0103    DYNAMIC     Fa0/3
```

- All entries marked **DYNAMIC**
    
- Associated with the correct interface

## 📘 What You Just Learned

|Topic|What You Observed|
|---|---|
|MAC Learning Mechanism|Switch learns source MACs from **every frame** it receives|
|ARP Request & Reply|Triggers MAC learning when devices don’t know each other|
|ICMP Traffic|Continues MAC learning if a MAC wasn’t already known|
|MAC Address Table|Populates dynamically and reflects the **port-to-MAC** relationships|
|Flooding vs. Unicast|Switch floods unknown MACs; unicast goes only to known destination ports|

---

## ⏳ Bonus: MAC Aging (Optional)

If you **wait 5 minutes** with no traffic, run:

```bash
SW1# show mac address-table
```

✅ Some entries may disappear. That’s because **dynamic MACs age out** if no frames are received from that MAC.

---

## 🛠 Bonus: Manual Clear

Try:

```bash
SW1# clear mac address-table dynamic interface FastEthernet0/1
```

✅ Removes all learned MACs from that interface.
