2.1Awesome. You’re now **part of a network deployment project**, and I’m assigning you tasks just like you're on a junior network team 💼.

We'll start simple, focusing **on the devices one by one**, then grow your understanding step by step using **Cisco Packet Tracer** as your lab environment.

## 🚧 **Phase 1: Your First Assignment – End Device Setup**

### 🎯 **Objective**:

Understand the behavior of end devices (PCs) and their role in communication.

---

### ✅ **Tools You’ll Need:**

- **Cisco Packet Tracer** (download from NetAcad if you haven’t)
    
- Just use the built-in **PC**, **cables**, and **logical workspace**
    
- No switch or router yet

### 🧪 **Assignment 1.1 – Connect 2 PCs Directly**

#### 🎯 Task:

Connect 2 PCs with a **crossover cable**, assign static IP addresses, and use `ping` to test.

#### 💻 Step-by-Step:

1. Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
    
2. Drag **2 PCs** onto the canvas.
    
3. Select the **crossover cable** (orange lightning bolt).
    
    - Connect: PC0 → PC1
        
4. Click PC0 → Desktop → IP Configuration:
    
    - IP Address: `192.168.1.1`
        
    - Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`
        
5. Click PC1 → Desktop → IP Configuration:
    
    - IP Address: `192.168.1.2`
        
    - Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`
        
6. Test:
    
    - On PC0 → Desktop → Command Prompt → `ping 192.168.1.2`
        

#### 📝 What to observe:

- Does the ping succeed?
    
- What happens if you unplug the cable or mismatch IP ranges?

### 🧪 **Assignment 1.2 – Add a Third PC**

#### 🎯 Task:

Try to connect 3 PCs directly and see what happens. Can they all communicate?

1. Add **PC2** to the canvas.
    
2. Try to connect it directly to PC0 or PC1.
    
3. Assign IP: `192.168.1.3`
    
4. Try to `ping` PC2 from PC0 or PC1.
    

#### 🧠 Purpose:

You’ll realize you need an intermediary device – a **switch** – to properly connect more than 2 hosts.

## 🏗️ **Phase 2 Sneak Peek: Layer 2 Device**

Once you're done with Phase 1, your **next assignment** will be to introduce a **switch**, build your first LAN, and observe **MAC address learning**.

Let me know once you're done and I’ll assign your **Switching project** next.

Would you like me to prepare a **checklist worksheet** or tracker to follow your tasks?
