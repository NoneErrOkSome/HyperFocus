# üßæ Assignment 4 ‚Äì **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Echo Request and Echo Reply Internals**

---

## üéØ **Objective**

Understand how the **ICMP protocol** is used to test connectivity between devices by analyzing the flow of **Echo Request** and **Echo Reply** messages. You‚Äôll observe how switches handle these unicast frames and how **IP layer communication** works across devices in a local area network (LAN).

---

## üß† **Why This Matters**

Ping is one of the most powerful and commonly used troubleshooting tools in networking. But **ping** is not a command by itself ‚Äî it uses a protocol called **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)** underneath. When you use `ping`, your device sends an **ICMP Echo Request**, and the other device responds with an **ICMP Echo Reply**.

In this assignment, you will:

- Understand the **full lifecycle of a ping**
    
- Watch how **Layer 3 (Internet Protocol)** and **Layer 2 (Ethernet)** work together
    
- Recognize the **unicast nature of ICMP traffic**
    
- Learn how devices and switches behave during the ping process
    

---

## ‚úÖ **What You Will Do**

You will reuse your current topology:

- **3 PCs** (PC0, PC1, PC2)
    
- **1 Layer 2 switch**
    
- All devices configured with static IP addresses in the same subnet

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Instructions

---

### üîß Step 1 ‚Äì Prepare Environment

1. On the switch, clear the MAC table:
    

```bash
SW1# clear mac address-table dynamic
```

2. On each PC:
    

- Go to **Desktop > Command Prompt**
    
- Clear ARP cache:
    

```bash
arp -d
```

---

### üîç Step 2 ‚Äì Go Into Simulation Mode

1. Switch to **Simulation Mode** (bottom right).
    
2. Click **Edit Filters** (funnel icon).
    
3. Enable only the following:
    
    - `Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)` ‚úÖ
        
    - `Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)` ‚úÖ
        

---

### üß™ Step 3 ‚Äì Send a Ping

On **PC0**, enter the command:

```bash
ping 192.168.1.3
```

Step through the packets using **‚ÄúCapture/Forward‚Äù** button.

---

## üî¨ What to Watch For:

---

### üü¶ 1. ICMP Echo Request Frame

- **Sent from PC0 to PC2**
    
- Contains:
    
    - Layer 3: Source IP `192.168.1.1`, Destination IP `192.168.1.3`
        
    - Layer 2: Source MAC = PC0‚Äôs MAC, Destination MAC = PC2‚Äôs MAC
        
- **Type**: Unicast
    

üí° **Why**: Now that ARP has resolved the MAC address of PC2, PC0 sends the echo request directly to it.

---

### üü™ 2. ICMP Echo Reply Frame

- **Sent from PC2 to PC0**
    
- Contains:
    
    - Layer 3: Source IP `192.168.1.3`, Destination IP `192.168.1.1`
        
    - Layer 2: Source MAC = PC2‚Äôs MAC, Destination MAC = PC0‚Äôs MAC
        
- **Type**: Unicast
    

üí° **Why**: PC2 responds directly to PC0. The switch uses its MAC table to forward this frame only on the port where PC0 is connected.

---

### üìÑ 3. MAC Table After Ping

Back on the switch, run:

```bash
SW1# show mac address-table
```

‚úÖ You should now see entries for both PC0 and PC2.

## üìò What You Learned

|Concept|What You Observed|
|---|---|
|ICMP Echo Request|The message sent to test reachability ‚Äî unicast, uses known MAC address|
|ICMP Echo Reply|The response confirming connectivity ‚Äî also unicast, returned to the sender|
|IP Layer|ICMP is encapsulated in Internet Protocol (IP) packets|
|Ethernet Layer|IP packets are encapsulated in Ethernet frames using source and destination MACs|
|Switch Behavior|Switch forwards unicast frames based on its MAC address table|
|Ping Success|Indicates full Layer 2 (Ethernet) and Layer 3 (Internet Protocol) communication|

---

## üß† Bonus Insight ‚Äì The ‚ÄúFirst Ping Fails‚Äù Phenomenon

Sometimes the **first ping fails** but the rest succeed.

üí° Why?

- The **first ping triggers an ARP request**.
    
- While the switch waits for the reply, the ICMP Echo Request may **time out**.
    
- Once the ARP reply is received, the next pings succeed.
    

You can try this behavior by:

```bash
PC0 > arp -d
PC0 > ping 192.168.1.3
```

You might see:

```
Request timed out.
Reply from 192.168.1.3...
```
