# 🧾 Assignment 3 – ARP + Broadcast Behavior (with Simulation & Troubleshooting)

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

Explore how devices discover each other’s MAC addresses using **ARP**, and observe how **Layer 2 switches handle broadcast vs. unicast frames**. You will learn how the switch dynamically builds its MAC table by analyzing these interactions.

---

## 🧠 **Why This Matters**

When you use `ping 192.168.1.3`, your PC doesn’t know what MAC address belongs to that IP. Since **Ethernet requires MAC addresses** to send data, your PC must first **discover the MAC using ARP**.

Understanding this step-by-step process teaches you:

- Why ARP is essential for any IP-based communication on a LAN
    
- How a switch processes different types of frames
    
- How dynamic learning of MAC addresses happens
    
- How to use **Simulation Mode to visually understand Ethernet communication**
    

Without ARP, **no communication happens** — this is the glue between Layer 3 (IP) and Layer 2 (Ethernet).

---

## 🧰 **What You’ll Need**

- Your current Packet Tracer project with 3 PCs and 1 switch
    
- PC IPs:
    
    - PC0: `192.168.1.1`
        
    - PC1: `192.168.1.2`
        
    - PC2: `192.168.1.3`
        
- All connected to switch ports via straight-through cables
    

---

## ✅ **What You’ll Do**

---

### 🔧 Step 1 – Prepare the Environment (Fresh ARP & MAC Table)

1. On the switch:
    

```bash
SW1# clear mac address-table dynamic
SW1# show mac address-table
```

2. On each PC (PC0, PC1, PC2):
    

- Go to **Desktop > Command Prompt**
    
- Clear ARP cache:
    

```bash
arp -d
```

✅ **Why**: Clears old MAC and ARP info so we can **observe the ARP process from scratch.**

---

### 🔍 Step 2 – Enable and Filter Simulation Mode

1. Click **Simulation Mode** (bottom right corner).
    
2. Click the **Edit Filters (funnel icon)**.
    
3. Check:
    
    - `ARP` ✅
        
    - `ICMP` ✅
        
4. Uncheck others (like `DTP`, `STP`, `DNS`, etc.) ❌ to avoid clutter.
    

✅ **Why**: This lets you clearly watch only the ARP and ICMP exchanges for this lesson.

---

### 🧪 Step 3 – Trigger ARP Using Ping

1. On **PC0**, run:
    

```bash
ping 192.168.1.3
```

2. Use **“Capture/Forward”** button to step through the simulation.

## 🔬 What to Watch For (Visually in Simulation)

---

### 🟨 1. ARP Request Frame

- Source MAC: PC0’s MAC
    
- Destination MAC: `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF` (Broadcast)
    
- Message: _“Who has 192.168.1.3? Tell 192.168.1.1”_
    

💡 **Why**: PC0 doesn’t know PC2’s MAC, so it sends a **broadcast** ARP frame.

---

### 🟩 2. Switch Floods the Broadcast

- The switch **forwards ARP request to all ports**, except the one it came from.
    

💡 **Why**: Switches flood **broadcast frames** — all devices receive it.

---

### 🟥 3. ARP Reply from PC2 (Unicast)

- PC2 sends the reply directly to PC0.
    
- Switch **does not flood** this — it forwards it only on the port where PC0 is.
    

💡 **Why**: ARP reply is **unicast** — destination MAC is known now.

---

### 📄 4. MAC Table Inspection

Back on the switch:

```bash
SW1# show mac address-table
```

✅ You should see new entries:

- PC0 and PC2 MACs linked to their ports.
    
- Type: `DYNAMIC`
    

---

## 🔁 Optional: Try from PC2

On **PC2**, repeat:

```bash
arp -d
ping 192.168.1.1
```

Then check the MAC table again.

---

## 🧠 Summary – What You Learned

|Concept|What You Observed|
|---|---|
|ARP Request|Sent as **broadcast** to discover MAC of known IP|
|ARP Reply|Sent as **unicast** after destination device replies|
|Switch Broadcast|Forwards frames out **all ports except the source**|
|Switch Unicast|Forwards frame to **specific port** when destination MAC is known|
|MAC Table Population|Switch learns **source MACs** and adds them to its table dynamically|
|Simulation Mode|Allows **step-by-step analysis** of Ethernet and ARP behavior|

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Checklist

If you don’t see ARP in Simulation:

### 🔁 Fix #1 – Check Event Filters

- Edit Filters > Make sure **ARP** and **ICMP** are ✅
    

### 🔁 Fix #2 – ARP Cache Is Already Filled

- Run `arp -d` on the PC
    
- Then ping again to retrigger ARP
    

### 🔁 Fix #3 – Switch Already Learned MACs

- Clear MAC table on switch:
    

```bash
SW1# clear mac address-table dynamic
```
