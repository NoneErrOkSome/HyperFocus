# My Rust Learning Journey

Hello! My name is Lek, and welcome to my Rust learning journey. As someone new to programming, I have embarked on this path to explore the exciting world of technology, focusing on Rust and WebAssembly (WASM). 

## About Me

I believe in the future of WASM, and I see Rust as a powerful tool to tap into that potential. Despite being relatively new to programming, I'm determined to dive deep into these topics and figure out my way into this vast tech universe.

### Why Rust?

Rust's safety, concurrency, and efficiency have piqued my interest, and I see it as a gateway to understanding systems programming and WASM's capabilities.

### Competitive Learning

Learning doesn't have to be a solo journey. That's why I've structured my learning process around challenges and mini-lessons. These fun and engaging exercises encourage me to push my boundaries and make the learning process more competitive and enjoyable.

### My Goals

- Master the fundamentals of Rust, from variables and data types to advanced concepts like concurrency.
- Explore the world of WebAssembly and understand its applications.
- Grow as a programmer and build a solid foundation for future learning.

### Special Thanks

A heartfelt thanks to OpenAI's ChatGPT for being an instrumental part of this journey, guiding me through the intricate details of Rust and aiding in my understanding of programming concepts.
