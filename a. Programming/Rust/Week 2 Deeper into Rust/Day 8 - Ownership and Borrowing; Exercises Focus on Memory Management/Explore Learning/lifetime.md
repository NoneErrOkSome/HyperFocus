No, lifetimes in Rust do not allocate memory. Lifetimes are a compile-time concept used to ensure that references are valid for the duration of their scope. They act as "annotations" that give the Rust compiler information about how long references should be valid, so it can check for things like dangling references or data races. Lifetimes help to enforce Rust's safety guarantees, but they don't have any runtime overhead like memory allocation. 

In essence, a lifetime is a way for you to express your intent to the compiler: "Hey, I want this reference to be valid for this long, and I want you to check that for me!" The compiler then verifies your intent without actually needing to allocate or manage memory during runtime specifically for the lifetime itself.

Here's a small example to help clarify:

```rust
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}

fn main() {
    let string1 = String::from("long string is long");
    let result;
    {
        let string2 = String::from("xyz");
        result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2.as_str());
    }
    // This won't compile because the compiler knows that `string2` has a shorter lifetime than `result`
    // println!("The longest string is {}", result);
}
```

In this example, the compiler uses the lifetimes to ensure that `result` doesn't outlive `string2`, thus preventing a dangling reference. There's no extra memory allocated for these lifetime checks; they're all done at compile-time.

So, in summary, lifetimes are all about safety and making sure your references are valid, not about memory management at runtime. ðŸ˜Š
