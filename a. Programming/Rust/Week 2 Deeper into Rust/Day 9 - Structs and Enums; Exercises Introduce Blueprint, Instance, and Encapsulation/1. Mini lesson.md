### 📖 Day 9: Dive into Structs and Enums; Understand how to create blueprints, instances, and encapsulate data in Rust

Welcome to Day 9 of our Rust journey! Today, we'll be delving into some of Rust's core data structures, specifically structs and enums, and understanding how they help in organizing data.

#### Structs: Blueprint for Data

In Rust, a struct, or structure, is a composite data type that groups together variables under a named definition. Think of a struct as a blueprint for a data type, defining what the type consists of.

**Defining a Struct:**

```rust
struct Car {
    make: String,
    model: String,
    year: u16,
}

// Creating an instance of a struct
let my_car = Car {
    make: "Toyota".to_string(),
    model: "Camry".to_string(),
    year: 2020,
};
```

**Methods and Encapsulation:**

Structs can also have methods associated with them, and encapsulation is used to protect the integrity of the data.

```rust
impl Car {
    fn get_year(&self) -> u16 {
        self.year
    }
}
```

#### Enums: Flexible Enumeration

An enum, or enumeration, is a data type consisting of a set of named values, called variants. Enums allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible values.

**Defining an Enum:**

```rust
enum TrafficLight {
    Red,
    Yellow,
    Green,
}

// Using an Enum
let current_light = TrafficLight::Red;
```

**Pattern Matching with Enums:**

Enums can be used with pattern matching to handle various possibilities in a concise and clear way.

```rust
match current_light {
    TrafficLight::Red => println!("Stop!"),
    TrafficLight::Yellow => println!("Slow down."),
    TrafficLight::Green => println!("Go!"),
}
```

#### Conclusion

Structs and enums are powerful tools in Rust that allow you to create custom types, encapsulate data, and handle various conditions elegantly. Understanding how to use these will significantly enhance your ability to write robust and efficient code in Rust.

Now, practice your newfound knowledge by attempting the challenges and exercises provided for Day 9. Happy coding!

### 📖➡️ Day 9: Continue learning about Structs and Enums; Further explore blueprints, instances, and encapsulation.

Continuing our exploration of structs and enums, we'll now dive deeper into advanced concepts, like tuple structs, associated functions, and methods.

#### Tuple Structs: Simplified Structs

Rust supports tuple structs, which are like basic structs but without named fields. They are useful when you want to give a whole tuple a name.

```rust
struct Point(u32, u32);

let origin = Point(0, 0);
```

#### Associated Functions

Associated functions are functions that are associated with a struct (or enum) but not with any particular instance. A common use is for constructors.

```rust
impl Car {
    fn new(make: &str, model: &str, year: u16) -> Car {
        Car {
            make: make.to_string(),
            model: model.to_string(),
            year,
        }
    }
}

let my_car = Car::new("Toyota", "Camry", 2020);
```

#### Enum Variants with Data

Enum variants can also carry data, and this can be combined with pattern matching for elegant handling.

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(u8, u8, u8),
}

let msg = Message::Write("Hello".to_string());

match msg {
    Message::Quit => println!("Quit"),
    Message::Move { x, y } => println!("Move to ({}, {})", x, y),
    Message::Write(text) => println!("Text message: {}", text),
    Message::ChangeColor(r, g, b) => println!("Change color to RGB({}, {}, {})", r, g, b),
}
```

#### Encapsulation and Access Control

In Rust, you can control access to parts of your struct by using the `pub` keyword. This allows for encapsulation of data.

```rust
pub struct Person {
    pub name: String,
    age: u8, // Private field
}

impl Person {
    pub fn new(name: &str, age: u8) -> Person {
        Person {
            name: name.to_string(),
            age,
        }
    }

    // Public method to access private field
    pub fn get_age(&self) -> u8 {
        self.age
    }
}
```

#### Conclusion

Advanced features of structs and enums allow you to write more organized, reusable, and encapsulated code. From defining simple named tuples to controlling access to data, these features empower you to create robust Rust code.

Continue to practice these concepts with exercises and challenges for Day 9. These hands-on experiences will solidify your understanding of these essential Rust features. Happy coding!
