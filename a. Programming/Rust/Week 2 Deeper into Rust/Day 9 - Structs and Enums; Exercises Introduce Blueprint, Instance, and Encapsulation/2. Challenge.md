### ðŸŽ¯ Day 9: Engage in exercises to practice creating and using structs and enums, applying encapsulation, and building instances in Rust.

#### Challenge 1: Define a Struct for a Student

Create a struct named `Student` with fields for name, age, and a vector of grades. Implement associated functions for creating a new student and a method to calculate the average grade.

#### Challenge 2: Enum for Traffic Light

Create an enum named `TrafficLight` with three variants: Red, Yellow, Green. Implement a method that takes a `TrafficLight` variant and returns the number of seconds that light should be active.

#### Challenge 3: Library System with Structs and Enums

Design a simple library system with structs for `Book`, `Author`, and an enum for `BookStatus` (Available, Borrowed, Reserved). Implement methods for borrowing, returning, and reserving books.

#### Challenge 4: Using Tuple Structs

Create a tuple struct named `Color` with three fields representing RGB values. Implement a method that takes two `Color` instances and returns a blended color.

#### Challenge 5: Encapsulation with a Bank Account

Design a `BankAccount` struct with private fields for account number and balance. Implement public methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance.

#### Challenge 6: Pattern Matching with Enums

Create an enum for a game character's status (Alive, Dead, Poisoned, Paralyzed). Write a function that takes the status and returns an appropriate message using pattern matching.

#### Challenge 7: Inheritance with Structs

While Rust doesn't have classical inheritance, you can achieve similar functionality with structs. Create a base struct for `Vehicle` and two other structs for `Car` and `Boat`. Use composition to include the common properties.

These challenges cover a wide range of topics related to structs and enums. Take your time and don't hesitate to refer back to the lessons or Rust's documentation. Enjoy the process of learning and building your skills!
