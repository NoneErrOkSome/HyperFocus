üìñ **Day 11 Mini-Lesson: Rust Modules, Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Error Handling**

Rust has a very expressive module system that favors encapsulation and follows a hierarchical file structure. This system allows you to organize your code effectively, manage visibility, and reuse code across projects. Let's dive into these concepts.

### Modules

Modules in Rust are used to group related definitions together. This makes your program clearer and easier to manage.

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}
```

### Paths

A path in Rust is a way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module.

- **Absolute Path**: Starts from the crate root.
- **Relative Path**: Starts from the current module.

### Access Control (Visibility)

Rust provides keywords like `pub` to make items like functions, structs, enums, or modules accessible outside the module where they are defined.

```rust
pub fn public_function() {}
fn private_function() {}
```

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the act of enclosing something in or as if in a capsule. In programming, this means restricting access to some of an object's components. This can be achieved in Rust using visibility modifiers.

### Abstraction

Abstraction in programming refers to hiding the complex reality while exposing only essential parts. In Rust, this can be done by providing public functions as an API and keeping internal details private.

### Error Handling Within Modules

Rust allows handling errors within modules using the `Result` and `Option` types, enabling more refined error handling and reporting.

### Using Modules Across Files

You can split your modules across different files to keep the codebase maintainable.

Example:

```rust
// in lib.rs
mod front_of_house;

// in front_of_house.rs
pub mod hosting {
    pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
}
```

By organizing your code using modules, encapsulation, and abstraction, you can create a scalable and maintainable codebase. Rust's strong typing and compiler checks further assist in catching errors early, making development more robust.

In this continuation, we'll gain deeper insights into how you can efficiently organize code using Rust's module system, manage the visibility of different elements, and reuse code across different parts of your program or even across different projects.

### Organizing Code

Rust's module system allows you to categorize your code into separate modules. Here's an extended example:

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }

    mod serving {
        fn take_order() {}
        fn serve_order() {}
        fn take_payment() {}
    }
}
```

In this structure, the `hosting` module is public, while the `serving` module is private.

### Managing Visibility

Visibility controls in Rust enable you to define what's accessible outside a module and what isn't. You can mark functions, structs, enums, or entire modules with the `pub` keyword to make them accessible outside their defining module.

### Using the `use` Keyword

The `use` keyword in Rust brings names into scope, making it easier to refer to them without needing the full path. This makes code more concise and readable.

```rust
use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

### Reusing Code Across Projects

Rust's Cargo package manager allows you to create libraries and share them across different projects. By defining a library crate, you can use your code in different applications by simply importing the library.

### Nested Modules

You can also define nested modules to create a more detailed hierarchy, reflecting the different components and functionalities of your codebase.

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub mod events {
            pub fn book_event() {}
        }
    }
}
```

### Summary

Rust's module system offers a powerful way to organize code, manage visibility, and create reusable components. By understanding how to utilize modules, `pub`, `use`, and Cargo, you can create well-structured, maintainable, and scalable codebases in Rust. Whether you are working on a small project or a large-scale application, these concepts will be essential in your Rust development journey.
