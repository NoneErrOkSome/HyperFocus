ðŸŽ¯ **Challenge Day 11: Working with Modules, Structuring Code, Encapsulation, and Abstraction in Rust**

Welcome to the challenge day for Day 11! Today's exercises are designed to help you apply what you've learned about modules, code structuring, encapsulation, and abstraction in Rust. These are essential concepts for writing maintainable and scalable Rust code.

### Task 1: Module Organization
Create a library named `library`, with two submodules: `math` and `string_utils`. `math` should contain functions for basic arithmetic operations, and `string_utils` should contain functions to manipulate strings.

### Task 2: Managing Visibility
In the same `library`, make some functions public and some private. Create a binary crate that uses this library and demonstrates the access levels.

### Task 3: Using the `use` Keyword
Reorganize the code from Task 1 to use the `use` keyword to bring specific functions or modules into scope, reducing redundancy in the code.

### Task 4: Create Nested Modules
Define a module named `network`, and inside it create nested modules representing different layers of a network stack (e.g., `transport`, `internet`, `link`). Implement dummy functions in each submodule that print the name of the layer.

### Task 5: Error Handling in Modules
Create a module named `file_operations` with functions to read and write a file. Implement custom error handling for different file operation errors like "File Not Found", "Permission Denied", etc.

### Task 6: Cross-Project Code Reuse
Create two separate projects, one as a library and the other as a binary crate. Demonstrate how you can use the library crate in your binary crate to perform specific tasks. Share common code between the projects.

### Summary

These tasks guide you through key aspects of Rust's modular programming, helping you learn how to structure your code, manage visibility, work with nested modules, handle errors within modules, and reuse code across projects. Understanding these principles is fundamental to building robust and reusable code in Rust.
