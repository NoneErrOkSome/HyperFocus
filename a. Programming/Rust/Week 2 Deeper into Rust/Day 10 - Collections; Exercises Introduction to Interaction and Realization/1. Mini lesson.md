### üìñ Day 10: Delve into Rust Collections; Learn about vectors, strings, and hash maps in Rust.

Collections are data structures that store multiple values. In Rust, the standard library provides several collections to store a collection of data in memory, each with different capabilities and use cases.

#### 1. **Vectors**:
   - A vector is a growable array that stores elements of the same type.
   - Defined using `Vec<T>`, where `T` is the type of elements.
   - You can add and remove elements dynamically.

   ```rust
   let mut v = Vec::new(); // an empty vector
   v.push(5);
   v.push(6);
   ```

#### 2. **Strings**:
   - `String` is a growable, UTF-8 encoded string type.
   - You can manipulate its contents and grow the string dynamically.
   - `&str` is an immutable reference to a string slice.

   ```rust
   let mut s = String::from("hello");
   s.push_str(", world!"); // appends to the string
   ```

#### 3. **Hash Maps**:
   - Hash maps store key-value pairs and provide fast lookup by key.
   - Defined using `HashMap<K, V>`, where `K` is the key type and `V` is the value type.
   - You can insert and remove key-value pairs, and query values by key.

   ```rust
   use std::collections::HashMap;

   let mut scores = HashMap::new();
   scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
   scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);
   ```

### Summary:
- **Vectors** allow you to store multiple values of the same type.
- **Strings** enable you to handle textual data, with UTF-8 encoding support.
- **Hash Maps** facilitate efficient key-value storage and lookup.

By understanding these collections, you can handle various data structures effectively in Rust, suitable for different scenarios and requirements. You can select the appropriate collection type based on your needs and performance considerations.

### üìñ‚û°Ô∏è Day 10: Continue Exploring Rust Collections; Understand the Interaction and Realization of Various Collection Types.

Building upon the previous section, let's dive deeper into how Rust collections interact with each other and their underlying realization.

#### 1. **Iterating over Collections**:
   - You can iterate over vectors, strings, and hash maps to perform operations on each element.

   ```rust
   // Iterating over a vector
   for i in &v {
      println!("{}", i);
   }

   // Iterating over a string's characters
   for c in "hello".chars() {
      println!("{}", c);
   }

   // Iterating over a hash map's key-value pairs
   for (key, value) in &scores {
      println!("{}: {}", key, value);
   }
   ```

#### 2. **Accessing Elements**:
   - Use indexing for vectors.
   - For hash maps, use the `get` method.

   ```rust
   let third = v[2]; // Accessing vector
   let score = scores.get("Blue"); // Accessing hash map
   ```

#### 3. **Updating Values**:
   - Vectors and hash maps allow modification.
   - Strings can also be modified and concatenated.

   ```rust
   v[1] = 7; // Updating vector
   scores.insert("Blue", 20); // Updating hash map
   s += ", world!"; // Concatenating strings
   ```

#### 4. **Error Handling**:
   - Be cautious with indexing; it can panic if the index is out of bounds.
   - Use methods like `get` to return `Option` for safe access.

   ```rust
   let third = v.get(2); // Returns Option<&T>
   ```

#### 5. **Realization and Memory Layout**:
   - Collections like vectors and strings store their data on the heap.
   - They keep track of their length and capacity.
   - Hash maps utilize hashing for quick access, and their implementation handles collisions and resizes as needed.

### Summary:
- You can **interact** with collections using various methods for iteration, access, modification, and error handling.
- **Realization** refers to how these collections are implemented and managed in memory.
- Understanding these aspects helps you use collections effectively and efficiently in your Rust programs, recognizing their strengths and limitations for various tasks.

These insights allow you to handle more complex data structures, optimizing your code, and utilizing Rust's strong type system and safety features.
