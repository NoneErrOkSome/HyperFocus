### ðŸŽ¯ Day 10: Engage in Exercises to Practice Working with Vectors, Strings, Hash Maps, and Other Rust Collections, Building Practical Solutions.

#### Task 1: Working with Vectors
- Create a function that accepts a vector of integers and returns the sum, mean, and median of the numbers.
- Implement a function to add an element to the vector at a specified index.

#### Task 2: Manipulating Strings
- Write a function that takes a string and reverses its words. For example, "Rust is fun" becomes "fun is Rust".
- Create a function to convert a string into Pig Latin (move the first consonant or consonant cluster of each word to the end of the word and add "ay").

#### Task 3: Using Hash Maps
- Develop a program that uses a hash map to store and retrieve student names and their grades.
- Implement a function that takes a list of integers and returns a hash map indicating the number of times each number appears in the list.

#### Task 4: Combining Collections
- Design a program that uses a vector of hash maps to represent a list of cities and their associated information (e.g., name, population, GDP).
- Implement a function to filter the cities based on certain criteria (e.g., population greater than 1 million).

#### Task 5: Error Handling in Collections
- Create a function that takes a vector and an index and returns the element at that index. Handle the possibility of an out-of-bounds index by returning an `Option<T>`.

#### Task 6: Practical Application
- Develop a text interface that allows users to manage a collection (your choice of vector, string, or hash map). Implement functionalities for adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving elements.

### Summary:
- These exercises are designed to give you practical experience with Rust's standard collections, including vectors, strings, and hash maps.
- You'll practice creating, updating, and manipulating these collections, and apply error handling where necessary.
- By completing these tasks, you'll deepen your understanding of how these data structures function and how they can be applied in real-world scenarios.

Remember to adhere to Rust's principles, consider ownership and borrowing, and write code that is efficient, clean, and well-documented. Feel free to use online resources and the Rust documentation to assist you in these exercises.
