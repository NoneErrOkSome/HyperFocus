Certainly! Here are some challenge tasks for Day 12, focusing on multithreading, async programming, synchronization, and parallelism in Rust.

### ðŸŽ¯ Task 1: Basic Thread Creation

Create a Rust program that spawns four threads. Each thread should print its ID and a welcome message, like "Hello from thread number [THREAD_ID]!".

### ðŸŽ¯ Task 2: Shared Counter with Mutex

Build a Rust program that uses a shared counter protected by a Mutex. Spawn ten threads that each increment the counter by one. Print the final result after all threads have completed.

### ðŸŽ¯ Task 3: Sending Messages with Channels

Create a Rust program that spawns two threads. One thread should send a string message through a channel, and the other should receive it and print it. Experiment with sending multiple messages and receiving them in the correct order.

### ðŸŽ¯ Task 4: Parallel Map with Rayon

[Rayon](https://crates.io/crates/rayon) is a data-parallelism library for Rust. Create a program that uses Rayon to apply a function in parallel to all elements of a large vector. You could, for example, square all elements of a vector of integers.

### ðŸŽ¯ Task 5: Async and Await

Create a simple Rust async function that simulates downloading a file from the internet. It should print a message indicating the start of the download, wait for a few seconds (using `tokio::time::sleep` or a similar function), and then print a message indicating that the download is complete.

### ðŸŽ¯ Task 6: Dining Philosophers Problem

Implement the famous [Dining Philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem) problem using Rust. Five philosophers sit at a table around a bowl of spaghetti. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers, and each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. 

This exercise will help you apply mutexes and channels to solve a classic synchronization problem.

### Bonus Task: Parallel Quick Sort

Implement the Quick Sort algorithm in Rust, but parallelize it to run on multiple threads. You can split the sorting task into sub-tasks that run in parallel, joining them at the end to assemble the final sorted array.

These exercises will give you a thorough understanding of concurrency and parallelism concepts in Rust. Remember to follow Rust's ownership and borrowing rules, which will guide you in writing safe concurrent code. Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
