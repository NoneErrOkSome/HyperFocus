The code snippet you provided assigns a value to the variable `y`, but then immediately overwrites it without the variable being used. That's what's triggering the warning.

You can suppress the warning specifically for that piece of code by using the `#[allow(unused_assignments)]` attribute. Here's how you can apply it to your code:

```rust
fn main() {
    #[allow(unused_assignments)]
    {
        let mut y = 10.5;
        y = 15.5;
    }
    // rest of your code
}
```

However, it's worth mentioning that if you're receiving this warning, you may want to inspect the code to ensure that the behavior is intended. If you never use the value `10.5`, then it might make sense to simply initialize `y` with `15.5` or reevaluate the logic in this section of the code. Suppressing warnings can sometimes mask underlying issues or inefficiencies, so make sure to understand the code's intention before turning off warnings.
