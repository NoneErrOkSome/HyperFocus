Yes, exactly! In the expression `for _ in 0..n`, the `0..n` part means a range that starts from 0 and goes up to (but does not include) `n`. This will create a loop that iterates exactly `n` times, starting from index 0.

So if `n` is 5, the loop will run 5 times, corresponding to the indices 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since the variable `_` is used, the actual index value is ignored inside the loop, and the code inside the loop will run the same way for each iteration.
