### Day 4: Control Flow in Rust

Today's mini-lesson focuses on control flow in Rust, which includes understanding conditional statements, iterative loops, and pattern matching. These foundational concepts allow a program to decide and control the execution path based on certain conditions and logic.

#### **üìñ Conditional Statements**

In Rust, conditional statements are used to make decisions in the code based on certain conditions.

- **`if` Statement**: Executes a block of code if a condition is true.
  ```rust
  if x > 10 {
      println!("x is greater than 10");
  }
  ```

- **`if-else` Statement**: Adds an alternative block of code to execute if the condition is false.
  ```rust
  if x > 10 {
      println!("x is greater than 10");
  } else {
      println!("x is not greater than 10");
  }
  ```

- **`if-else if-else` Chain**: Multiple conditions can be chained together for more complex decision-making.
  ```rust
  if x > 10 {
      println!("x is greater than 10");
  } else if x == 10 {
      println!("x is 10");
  } else {
      println!("x is less than 10");
  }
  ```

#### **üìñ Iterative Loops**

Iterative loops allow repeating a block of code as long as a condition is true.

- **`loop`**: Infinite loop that continues executing until explicitly broken.
  ```rust
  loop {
      println!("This will run forever");
      break; // Breaks the loop
  }
  ```

- **`while` Loop**: Executes a block of code while a condition remains true.
  ```rust
  while x < 10 {
      println!("x is less than 10");
      x += 1;
  }
  ```

- **`for` Loop**: Iterates over a range or an iterable object.
  ```rust
  for i in 0..5 {
      println!("i is {}", i);
  }
  ```

#### **üìñ Pattern Matching**

Pattern matching is a powerful feature in Rust that allows matching values against patterns and executing code based on the matched pattern.

- **`match` Statement**: Similar to a switch case in other languages, it allows matching a value against multiple patterns.
  ```rust
  match x {
      1 => println!("One"),
      2 => println!("Two"),
      _ => println!("Other"), // Default case using _
  }
  ```

Pattern matching can be combined with enums, structs, and more for elegant and efficient code organization.

#### Summary

Control flow in Rust is about directing the execution path of a program based on conditions, loops, and pattern-matching. Understanding these concepts is essential for creating efficient and logical programs in Rust. They enable a program to adapt to different situations, repeat actions as needed, and simplify complex decision-making.

In the next part of our lesson, we can explore more complex examples and understand how these concepts integrate with each other. Feel free to ask questions or request specific examples! If you'd like to proceed to the next part, please use the `/next_part` command.

### Day 4 Continued: Control Flow in Rust

In this continuation of the mini-lesson on Control Flow in Rust, we'll delve deeper into the conditional statements, iterative loops, and pattern matching, demonstrating more intricate examples and their applications.

#### **üìñ‚û°Ô∏è Advanced Conditional Statements**

Rust allows combining conditional expressions using logical operators, such as `&&` (and), `||` (or), and `!` (not). This enables more complex decision-making.

```rust
if x > 10 && y < 20 {
    println!("x is greater than 10 and y is less than 20");
} else if x <= 10 || y >= 20 {
    println!("Either x is less or equal to 10 or y is greater or equal to 20");
}
```

#### **üìñ‚û°Ô∏è Nested Loops and Labels**

Loops can be nested, and Rust provides labels to identify and control specific loops.

```rust
'outer: for i in 0..5 {
    'inner: for j in 0..5 {
        if i * j == 4 {
            break 'outer; // This will break the outer loop
        }
    }
}
```

#### **üìñ‚û°Ô∏è Using `match` with Enums and Destructuring**

Pattern matching is particularly powerful when combined with enums and destructuring.

```rust
enum Shape {
    Circle(f64),
    Rectangle(f64, f64),
}

let shape = Shape::Circle(3.0);

match shape {
    Shape::Circle(radius) => println!("Circle with radius {}", radius),
    Shape::Rectangle(width, height) => println!("Rectangle with dimensions {}x{}", width, height),
}
```

#### **üìñ‚û°Ô∏è The `if let` Syntax**

Rust also provides the `if let` syntax for concise pattern matching when only one case matters.

```rust
if let Shape::Circle(radius) = shape {
    println!("This is a circle with radius {}", radius);
} else {
    println!("This is not a circle");
}
```

#### **üìñ‚û°Ô∏è Iterating Over Collections with `for` Loop**

The `for` loop is not only used with ranges but also to iterate over collections like arrays and vectors.

```rust
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for number in numbers.iter() {
    println!("Number: {}", number);
}
```

#### Summary

Control flow in Rust is expressive, flexible, and safe. Conditional statements allow for complex decision-making. Iterative loops provide various ways to repeat code execution, including labeled and nested loops. Pattern matching is a robust feature that works seamlessly with Rust's type system, offering an elegant way to handle various possibilities and complex data structures.

These control flow mechanisms are fundamental building blocks in Rust programming, enabling developers to write efficient, clean, and logical code. Whether dealing with simple conditions or intricate patterns, Rust's control flow constructs provide the tools to manage complexity with ease.
