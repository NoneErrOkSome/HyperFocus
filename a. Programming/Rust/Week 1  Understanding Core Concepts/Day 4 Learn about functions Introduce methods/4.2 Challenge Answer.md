Task 1
--
---

Your code for Day 4 Task 1 looks correct! Here's a brief explanation of what it does:

The `task41` function compares two integers, `x` and `y`. If `x` is equal to `y`, it prints that they are equal. If `x` is greater than `y`, it prints that `x` is more than `y`. Otherwise, it prints that `y` is more than `x`.

This is a typical example of using if-else statements in Rust to create a conditional logic flow. By comparing the values of `x` and `y`, the program determines their relative sizes and prints the appropriate statement.

You might want to consider making the function more flexible by accepting the two integers as parameters instead of hardcoding them. Here's a modified version:

```rust
pub fn task41(x: i32, y: i32) {
    if x == y {
        println!("x and y are equal");
    } else if x > y {
        println!("x is more than y");
    } else {
        println!("y is more than x");
    }
}
```

This way, you can call `task41` with different values for `x` and `y`, and compare various pairs of numbers.

Task 2

Certainly! Here's my solution for Day 4, Task 2 challenge, which implements the classic FizzBuzz problem using a match expression in Rust.

```rust
pub fn task42() {
    for i in 1..=100 {
        match (i % 3, i % 5) {
            (0, 0) => println!("FizzBuzz"),
            (0, _) => println!("Fizz"),
            (_, 0) => println!("Buzz"),
            _ => println!("{}", i),
        }
    }
}
```

Here's how the code works:

- We iterate through numbers from 1 to 100 using a for loop.
- Inside the loop, we use a match expression with a tuple `(i % 3, i % 5)` to check the divisibility of the current number `i` by 3 and 5.
- The first pattern `(0, 0)` matches if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, in which case we print "FizzBuzz."
- The next two patterns `(0, _)` and `(_, 0)` match if the number is divisible by 3 or 5, respectively, and we print "Fizz" or "Buzz" accordingly.
- The last pattern `_` is a catch-all pattern that matches any other number, and we print the number itself.

This solution uses pattern matching to succinctly capture the logic of the FizzBuzz problem and provides a clear and readable implementation.

Certainly! Let's compare the two answers:

**Your Answer:**
```rust
pub fn task42() {
    if !cfg!(feature = "task42") {return;}

    for i in 1..=100 {
        match i {
            _ if i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0 => println!("FizzBuzz"),
            _ if i % 3 == 0 => println!("Fizz"),
            _ if i % 5 == 0 => println!("Buzz"),
            _ => println!("{}", i),
        }
    }
}
```

**My Answer:**
```rust
pub fn task42() {
    for i in 1..=100 {
        match (i % 3, i % 5) {
            (0, 0) => println!("FizzBuzz"),
            (0, _) => println!("Fizz"),
            (_, 0) => println!("Buzz"),
            _ => println!("{}", i),
        }
    }
}
```

**Comparison:**

1. **Structure:** Both solutions use a for loop to iterate from 1 to 100 and a match statement to handle the FizzBuzz logic.

2. **Match Expression:**
   - Your solution matches directly against the value of `i` using guards with conditional logic (`if i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0`, etc.).
   - My solution uses a tuple with the remainders of division by 3 and 5, and patterns like `(0, 0)`, `(0, _)`, and `(_, 0)` to match against the divisibility conditions.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - Your solution will evaluate the conditions in the order they are written, stopping when it finds a match.
   - My solution uses pattern matching on a tuple, which may be slightly more concise, but the efficiency difference is negligible in this specific case.

4. **Other Differences:** Your solution includes a conditional compilation check `if !cfg!(feature = "task42") {return;}`, which is not present in my answer. This is an extra feature to conditionally compile the function based on a feature flag.

Overall, both solutions correctly implement the FizzBuzz problem and are valid. The differences lie mainly in the stylistic choices and how the match expression is constructed.

Task 3

In the context of the two given code snippets, let's compare the efficiency:

### Pattern 1: Using Repeat Method (Single Loop)
```rust
for i in 1..=10 {
    let s = "*".repeat(i);
    println!("{}", s);
}
```

### Pattern 2: Using Nested Loops
```rust
for i in 1..=10 {
    for _ in 1..=i {
        print!("*");
    }
    println!();
}
```

#### Efficiency Comparison

1. **Time Complexity**: Both patterns have a linear time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the upper limit of the outer loop (in this case, 10). In Pattern 1, the `repeat` method creates a new string of length `i` during each iteration of the loop, resulting in \(O(1 + 2 + \ldots + 10) = O(55)\). Pattern 2 has the same complexity due to the nested loop structure.

2. **Allocation Efficiency**: Pattern 1 allocates a new string during each iteration, using the `repeat` method. Pattern 2 avoids this allocation by printing characters directly to the standard output.

3. **Function Call Overhead**: Pattern 2 involves more function calls to `print!`, which could add some overhead compared to the single `println!` call in each iteration of Pattern 1.

### Conclusion

- In terms of **time complexity**, both patterns are similar.
- In terms of **memory efficiency**, Pattern 2 is likely more efficient because it avoids allocating a new string in each iteration.
- In terms of **function call overhead**, Pattern 1 might be slightly more efficient because it makes fewer function calls.

Overall, the differences in efficiency between these two patterns are likely to be negligible for such a simple use case. However, if efficiency is a primary concern, Pattern 2 (using nested loops without string allocation) might be a more optimal choice in terms of memory usage.

Keep in mind that such micro-optimizations are typically unnecessary in real-world applications, as the differences would not be noticeable. It's often more beneficial to choose a pattern based on readability, maintainability, and the specific requirements of the task at hand.

Task 4

Your code for Task 4 is a good implementation of pattern matching with enums to represent traffic light colors. You have correctly defined an enum with three variants for the traffic light colors, and you're using pattern matching to print the amount of time that each color stays on.

However, the task also mentions that the function should return the amount of time, not just print it. Here's a modified version of your code to meet that requirement:

```rust
enum Colors {
    Red,
    Yellow,
    Green,
}

fn light_color(colors: Colors) -> i32 {
    match colors {
        Colors::Red => 60,
        Colors::Yellow => 4,
        Colors::Green => 30,
    }
}

pub fn task44() {
    if !cfg!(feature = "task44") {return;}

    println!("Red: {} seconds", light_color(Colors::Red));
    println!("Yellow: {} seconds", light_color(Colors::Yellow));
    println!("Green: {} seconds", light_color(Colors::Green));
}
```

Here, I've simplified the `Colors` enum since the values for the times are fixed and don't need to be stored as associated data with each variant. The `light_color` function now returns an `i32`, representing the number of seconds for the corresponding color, and the calling code prints these values.

This version is more aligned with the problem statement, which specifies that the function should return the amount of time for each color.
