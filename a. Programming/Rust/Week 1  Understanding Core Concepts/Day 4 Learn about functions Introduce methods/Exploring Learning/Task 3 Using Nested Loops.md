In the context of the two given code snippets, let's compare the efficiency:

### Pattern 1: Using Repeat Method (Single Loop)
```rust
for i in 1..=10 {
    let s = "*".repeat(i);
    println!("{}", s);
}
```

### Pattern 2: Using Nested Loops
```rust
for i in 1..=10 {
    for _ in 1..=i {
        print!("*");
    }
    println!();
}
```

#### Efficiency Comparison

1. **Time Complexity**: Both patterns have a linear time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the upper limit of the outer loop (in this case, 10). In Pattern 1, the `repeat` method creates a new string of length `i` during each iteration of the loop, resulting in \(O(1 + 2 + \ldots + 10) = O(55)\). Pattern 2 has the same complexity due to the nested loop structure.

2. **Allocation Efficiency**: Pattern 1 allocates a new string during each iteration, using the `repeat` method. Pattern 2 avoids this allocation by printing characters directly to the standard output.

3. **Function Call Overhead**: Pattern 2 involves more function calls to `print!`, which could add some overhead compared to the single `println!` call in each iteration of Pattern 1.

### Conclusion

- In terms of **time complexity**, both patterns are similar.
- In terms of **memory efficiency**, Pattern 2 is likely more efficient because it avoids allocating a new string in each iteration.
- In terms of **function call overhead**, Pattern 1 might be slightly more efficient because it makes fewer function calls.

Overall, the differences in efficiency between these two patterns are likely to be negligible for such a simple use case. However, if efficiency is a primary concern, Pattern 2 (using nested loops without string allocation) might be a more optimal choice in terms of memory usage.

Keep in mind that such micro-optimizations are typically unnecessary in real-world applications, as the differences would not be noticeable. It's often more beneficial to choose a pattern based on readability, maintainability, and the specific requirements of the task at hand.
