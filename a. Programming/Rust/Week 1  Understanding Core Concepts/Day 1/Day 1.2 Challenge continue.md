Continuing with the Day 1 challenge, let's extend your learning with some additional tasks. These tasks will focus on reinforcing your understanding of variables, data types, and fundamental concepts in Rust.

### ðŸŽ¯ Additional Challenge Tasks

#### **Task 4: Working with Shadowing**
- Declare a variable `x` with value `5`.
- Now shadow `x` by multiplying it by 2 and printing the result.
- Again, shadow `x` by converting it to a string and printing the result.

#### **Task 5: Utilizing the Mutable Keyword**
- Declare a mutable variable `count` with value `0`.
- Create a loop that increments `count` by `1` until it reaches `10`.
- Print the final value of `count`.

#### **Task 6: Experimenting with Data Types**
- Create a function that takes two floating-point numbers as parameters and returns their sum.
- Call this function with different values and print the result.
- Experiment with using different numeric data types in the function.

### **Code Example**
You can start by writing the code for Task 4, and then proceed with the rest:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("---- Task 4 ----");
    let x = 5;
    let x = x * 2; // Shadowing
    println!("Value after multiplying by 2: {}", x);
    let x = x.to_string(); // Shadowing
    println!("Value as a string: {}", x);
}
```

Please go ahead and complete these tasks. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to ask. Happy coding! ðŸš€
