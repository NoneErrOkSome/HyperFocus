Absolutely! Let's get started with today's challenge focused on variables and data types in Rust.

### ðŸŽ¯ Challenge: Variables and Data Types in Rust

#### **Task 1: Declare and Initialize Variables**
- Declare an immutable integer variable `x` with value `5`.
- Declare a mutable float variable `y` with value `10.5`.
- Change the value of `y` to `15.5`.
- Display the values of `x` and `y`.

#### **Task 2: Work with Constants and Shadowing**
- Declare a constant `MAX_USERS` with type `u32` and value `100`.
- Declare an integer variable `z` with value `2`.
- Shadow `z` with a new value, which is its previous value multiplied by `5`.
- Display the values of `MAX_USERS` and `z`.

#### **Task 3: Understanding Tuples and Arrays**
- Declare a tuple `person` with values `(25, "Alice", 5.6)`.
- Destructure `person` and display its values separately.
- Declare an array `numbers` of type `i32` with `5` elements and display its first and last elements.

### **Hints and Considerations**
- Remember, variables are immutable by default in Rust, and you need the `mut` keyword to make them mutable.
- Constants must be declared with an explicit type.
- For tuple destructuring, you can use pattern matching.
- Arrays have a fixed size, and you can access elements using indexing.

### **Submission**
Please write and test your code in a Rust-compatible environment and provide the final code snippets for each task. If you face any difficulties or have any questions, feel free to ask for assistance.

### **Learning Outcomes**
- Gain hands-on experience with declaring variables, constants, and understanding mutability.
- Explore shadowing and how to use it effectively.
- Understand and work with basic compound data types like tuples and arrays.

This challenge aims to solidify your understanding of these foundational concepts in Rust. Good luck, and enjoy the coding challenge! ðŸš€
