Great! You've initiated the Day 2 challenge on variables and data types in Rust, focusing on exercises related to mutable and immutable variables, as well as understanding scalar and compound types. Here are some exercises for you to work on:

### **Task 1: Immutable vs Mutable Variables**
Write a function that demonstrates the difference between immutable and mutable variables. Show that you can change the value of a mutable variable but not an immutable one.

### **Task 2: Scalar and Compound Types**
Create a program that demonstrates the use of scalar and compound types. For scalar types, include integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters. For compound types, use arrays and tuples.

### **Task 3: Using Type Aliases**
Use type aliases to create a program that deals with distances in kilometers and meters. Convert distances using a conversion function.

### **Task 4: Slices and Copy Trait**
Write a function that accepts a slice of an array and returns some calculated value. Also, demonstrate the use of the `Copy` trait by creating an example where one variable is still usable after being assigned to another variable.

### **Task 5: Pattern Matching with Enums**
Create an enum representing different shapes (e.g., Circle, Square) and write a function that accepts the shape and returns its area using pattern matching.

### **Task 6: Ownership and Borrowing**
Write a function that takes ownership of a string and returns its length. Also, write a function that borrows a string and returns its length. Show how ownership and borrowing work in Rust.

Feel free to work on these tasks, and you can continue with the challenge using the `/challenge_day_continue "üéØ‚û°Ô∏è"` command when ready. If you have any questions or need further clarification on any of the tasks, please don't hesitate to ask!
