Sure! In Rust, the `Copy` trait is implemented by many of the simple, built-in types. These types can be copied by simply copying their bits, without any need for special logic. Here's a list of some of the standard types that implement the `Copy` trait:

### Scalar Types
- Integer Types: `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`, `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`
- Floating-Point Types: `f32`, `f64`
- `char`: Represents a single Unicode scalar value.
- `bool`: The boolean type, with values `true` or `false`.

### Pointer Types
- References: Both shared (`&T`) and mutable (`&mut T`) references are `Copy` if the type they refer to is `Copy`.
- Function pointers: Regular function pointers like `fn()` are `Copy`.

### Array and Tuple Types
- Arrays: Arrays of a `Copy` type are themselves `Copy`, as long as the array length is known at compile-time. For example, `[i32; 5]` is `Copy`, but a dynamically-sized array like `Vec<i32>` is not.
- Tuples: Tuples where all elements are `Copy` are themselves `Copy`. For example, `(i32, bool)` is `Copy`, but `(i32, String)` is not.

### Zero-Sized Types
- Types that occupy no space, such as unit `()` and custom zero-sized types, are `Copy`.

### Custom Types
- You can also make your custom structs or enums `Copy` by deriving the trait, provided that all their fields are `Copy`. For example:

```rust
#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
struct MyStruct {
    a: i32,
    b: bool,
}
```

Keep in mind that some types explicitly do not implement `Copy`, especially those that manage resources like memory allocation. Examples include `String`, `Vec<T>`, and most other collection types, as well as types that encapsulate file handles or other system resources.

By implementing or deriving the `Copy` trait for types that meet the requirements, you enable convenient and efficient duplication of values where appropriate.
