Correct, slicing itself does not create a copy of the data, and thus it does not involve the `Copy` trait directly. Instead, slicing creates a borrowed reference to a portion of the original data, allowing you to access that segment without duplicating it in memory.

Here's a brief overview to clarify:

- **Slicing**: When you slice an array or another slice in Rust, you create a borrowed reference to a part of the original data. This reference provides access to the selected segment without creating a new, independent copy of that segment.

- **Copy Trait**: A type implements the `Copy` trait if instances of that type can be duplicated simply by copying the bits representing their value. This trait is typically implemented for simple value types like integers, floating-point numbers, and small arrays of other `Copy` types.

Slicing works with types that implement the `Copy` trait (since you can slice an array of integers, for example), but the slicing operation itself does not create a copy. If you want to create a new, independent copy of the sliced data, you would have to do that explicitly, separate from the slicing operation itself.

Here's an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let slice = &my_array[2..4]; // Slicing, not copying
    let copied_slice: [i32; 2] = [slice[0], slice[1]]; // Explicitly copying the values from the slice

    println!("{:?}", slice); // Prints: [3, 4]
    println!("{:?}", copied_slice); // Prints: [3, 4]
}
```

In this code, `slice` is a borrowed reference created by slicing `my_array`, and `copied_slice` is a new array created by explicitly copying the values from `slice`. The slicing operation itself does not create a copy, but the values can be copied afterward because they are of a type that implements the `Copy` trait.

---
It seems like there are a few issues with the code you provided. Let's analyze the code and correct the problems step by step:

1. **Slicing Syntax**: The slicing syntax `&array[2..=4]` would create a slice with three elements, but the function signature expects an array of three references.

2. **Function Signature**: The function `some_slice` expects an array of references `&[&i32; 3]`, which doesn't match the type of the slice created in the main function.

3. **Slicing Inside the Function**: The slicing operation inside the function tries to slice an array of three references to a range of three elements, but there are only three elements in the input, so the range `2..=4` is out of bounds.

Here's a corrected version of the code that should demonstrate the concept you're trying to explore:

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_array: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let copy_trait: [i32; 5] = my_array;
    println!("{:?}", copy_trait); // Prints: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    let answer: i32 = some_slice(&my_array[2..=4]);
    println!("{:?}", answer); // Prints: 12
}

fn some_slice(slice: &[i32]) -> i32 {
    let mut result = 0;
    for &i in slice {
        result += i;
    }
    result
}
```

This code makes the following changes:

- The function signature for `some_slice` now takes a borrowed slice `&[i32]`, which matches the type created by slicing in the main function.
- The slicing operation inside the `some_slice` function is removed, as it's unnecessary in this context.

The function now sums the elements of the slice, which would be the integers 3, 4, and 5 from the original array, giving a result of 12.
