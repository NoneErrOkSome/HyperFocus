Recursion is a powerful tool in programming, but it's not always the best approach for every problem. Here's when you might consider using recursion:

### 1. **Problem Decomposition**

When a problem can naturally be divided into smaller instances of the same problem, recursion can be an elegant solution. 

### 2. **Clear and Concise Code**

Recursion often leads to cleaner and more readable code for problems that are inherently recursive, like tree traversal or the Tower of Hanoi. 

### 3. **Mathematical Problems**

Some mathematical problems, such as computing the factorial or Fibonacci sequence, have a straightforward recursive definition that can be directly translated into recursive code.

### 4. **Depth-First Search (DFS) in Graphs and Trees**

Recursion is commonly used in depth-first search algorithms where you want to explore all the way down to the leaf of a branch before backtracking.

### 5. **Algorithm Simplicity**

In some cases, recursive algorithms might be simpler and more intuitive than their iterative counterparts, even if they aren't necessarily more efficient.

### 6. **Functional Programming Patterns**

In functional programming languages and paradigms, recursion is often preferred over iteration. Even in a language like Rust, tail recursion (where the recursive call is the last operation in the function) can be optimized by the compiler to be as efficient as iteration.

### However, Consider These Caveats:

- **Efficiency**: Simple recursion may lead to redundant calculations (like the naive Fibonacci algorithm) and can be less efficient than iterative solutions or dynamic programming.
  
- **Stack Overflow**: Deeply nested recursion may lead to a stack overflow error if the recursive calls build up faster than they can be resolved. Tail recursion can mitigate this, but not all compilers optimize for it.
  
- **Complexity**: While recursion can simplify some problems, it can also make the code harder to follow and debug if not implemented carefully.

### Summary

Recursion is best used when the problem is inherently recursive, when it leads to clearer and more readable code, and when you are working within a paradigm or language where recursion is idiomatic or optimized. Care should be taken to consider the efficiency and maintainability of the recursive solution, and iterative or other methods should be considered where they might be more appropriate.
