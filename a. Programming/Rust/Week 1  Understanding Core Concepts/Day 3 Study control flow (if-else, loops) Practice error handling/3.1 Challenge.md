Great! The challenge for Day 3 focuses on exploring various ways to define and call functions in Rust. Here's the breakdown of tasks you can undertake:

### Task 1: Simple Function
Create a function that takes two integers and returns their sum. Call this function and print the result.

### Task 2: Function with Conditional Logic
Create a function that takes an integer and returns whether it's odd or even. Call this function and print the result.

### Task 3: Function Using Pattern Matching
Define an enum representing different shapes (Circle, Square, Rectangle). Create a function that takes a shape and returns its area using pattern matching.

### Task 4: Function Pointer
Create a function that takes another function (e.g., doubling a number) and an integer as arguments. Use this higher-order function to apply the passed function to the integer.

### Task 5: Closures
Define a closure that calculates the factorial of a number and use it within a function to calculate the factorial of 5.

### Task 6: Error Handling
Create a function that takes two integers and divides them. Use the `Result` type to handle the case when the second integer is zero, returning an error message in that case.

### Task 7: Recursion
Write a recursive function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth element. Call this function and print the result.

### Task 8: Optional Extra Challenge
Experiment with async functions or other advanced function concepts that interest you in Rust. Share your code and thoughts.

Remember to use appropriate function signatures, parameter passing, and return values to complete these tasks. You can take this challenge one step at a time, and feel free to ask for guidance or clarifications if needed. Good luck!
