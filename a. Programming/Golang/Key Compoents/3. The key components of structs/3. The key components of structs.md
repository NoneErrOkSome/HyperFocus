Here are the key components of structs in Go:

1. **Fields**:
   - The core part of a struct, fields are variables that hold data. Each field has a name and a type.
   - Fields define the structure and data that the struct will hold.
   - Example: `type Car struct { Brand string; Year int }` where `Brand` and `Year` are fields.

2. **Methods**:
   - Functions that are associated with a struct, defined with a receiver of the struct type.
   - Methods allow you to add behavior to structs, acting on the data contained in the struct.
   - Example: `func (c Car) Drive() { ... }` where `Drive` is a method of the `Car` struct.

3. **Tags**:
   - Metadata associated with struct fields, often used for parsing, validation, or other purposes (e.g., JSON, XML, database).
   - Tags are specified as strings after the field type and are commonly used in reflection.
   - Example: `type User struct { Name string `json:"name"` }`.

4. **Embedded Structs (Composition)**:
   - Structs can embed other structs to reuse fields and methods, promoting composition over inheritance.
   - Embedded structs allow you to create more complex types by combining simpler ones.
   - Example: `type Truck struct { Car }` where `Truck` embeds `Car`, inheriting its fields and methods.

5. **Receivers**:
   - When defining methods, receivers specify which struct the method belongs to.
   - Receivers can be value receivers (a copy of the struct) or pointer receivers (a reference to the struct).
   - Example: `func (c *Car) Start() { ... }` where `c` is a pointer receiver to `Car`.

These components define the structure, behavior, and use of structs in Go, making them a fundamental way to model data and encapsulate logic. Let me know if you need further clarification!
