Here’s the revised list with the additional interface questions included:

1. **Basic Struct Creation**:  
   Create a struct for a `Person` with fields `name`, `age`, and `city`. Then, create a function that accepts a `Person` and prints out their details.

2. **Methods on Structs**:  
   Define a struct `Rectangle` with fields `length` and `width`. Implement a method `Area()` that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.

3. **Pointer Receivers**:  
   Create a struct `Counter` with a field `value`. Write a method `Increment()` that increases the counter’s value by 1 using a pointer receiver.

4. **Function Returning Struct**:  
   Create a function `NewBook(title, author string)` that returns a struct `Book` with `title` and `author` fields.

5. **Struct Embedding**:  
   Define a struct `Employee` with fields `name` and `salary`. Then, define another struct `Manager` that embeds `Employee` and adds a field `department`.

6. **Working with Interfaces**:  
   Define an interface `Shape` with a method `Area() float64`. Then create two structs `Circle` and `Square`, and implement the `Shape` interface for both.

7. **Basic Interface Implementation**:  
   Define an interface `Describable` with a method `Describe() string`. Create two structs `Car` and `Bike`, each implementing the `Describable` interface. Write a function that accepts a `Describable` and prints its description.

8. **Interface with Multiple Methods**:  
   Define an interface `Transport` with methods `Speed() float64` and `Capacity() int`. Implement this interface for `Bus` and `Train` structs. Then, write a function that takes a `Transport` and prints its speed and capacity.

9. **Empty Interface (`interface{}`) Usage**:  
   Create a function `PrintDetails` that accepts an argument of type `interface{}` and prints different messages based on the underlying type (`int`, `string`, or a custom struct).

10. **Type Assertion with Interface**:  
    Define an interface `Shape` with a method `Area() float64`. Then create structs `Rectangle` and `Triangle` that implement the `Shape` interface. Write a function that takes a `Shape` and uses a type assertion to determine the specific type of shape before calculating its area.

11. **Embedding Interfaces**:  
    Define two interfaces, `Animal` with a method `Speak()` and `Mover` with a method `Move()`. Create a struct `Dog` that implements both interfaces, and write a function that accepts both `Animal` and `Mover` to demonstrate the embedded interface pattern.

12. **Array of Structs**:  
    Create an array of `Student` structs where each `Student` has a `name` and `grade`. Write a function to calculate the average grade of all students.

13. **Using Maps**:  
    Create a map where the keys are strings (country names) and the values are structs that store `population` and `capital`. Write a function to print the population of a given country.

14. **Slices and Methods**:  
    Create a struct `ShoppingCart` with a field `items` (a slice of strings). Write methods to `AddItem(item string)` and `RemoveItem(item string)` from the cart.

15. **Simple Switch Statement**:  
    Write a function `DayType(day string)` that takes a day of the week and returns whether it's a weekday or weekend using a switch statement.

Now, this list introduces interfaces and expands on their concepts before moving on to arrays and other topics.
