6. **Working with Interfaces**:  
   Define an interface `Shape` with a method `Area() float64`. Then create two structs `Circle` and `Square`, and implement the `Shape` interface for both.

```go
package main
import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)

type Shape interface {
    Area() float64\
}

type Circle struct {
    radius float64
}

type Square struct {
    side float64
}

func (c Circle) Area() float64 {
    return math.Pi * math.Pow(c.radius, 2)
}

func (s Square) Area() float64 {
    return s.side * s.side
}


func main() {

    var shape Shape = Circle{radius: 4}
    fmt.Println(shape.Area())

    shape = Square{side: 10}
    fmt.Println(shape.Area())

}
```

Yes, you’ve grasped the concept very well! It does work like layers, and here's a clearer breakdown of what you're describing:

### **Understanding the Layers: Structs vs. Interfaces**

1. **Using Only Structs: Access Fields Directly**
   - When you declare a variable of a struct type, you can access the fields directly and use methods defined on the struct.
   
   ```go
   // Define a struct
   type Circle struct {
       Radius float64
   }

   // Create an instance of the struct
   var x Circle = Circle{Radius: 5}

   // Access the struct's field
   fmt.Println(x.Radius) // Output: 5

   // Use a method on the struct instance (if defined)
   // x.Area() would call a method on the Circle if defined
   ```

2. **Using Interfaces: Calling Methods Through Interface Variables**
   - When you declare a variable of an interface type, you cannot access fields directly because the interface only knows about methods.
   - You assign a value of a struct (or other type) that implements the interface to the interface variable.
   - You call methods through the interface, and Go will use the implementation provided by the assigned struct.

   ```go
   // Define an interface with a method signature
   type Shape interface {
       Area() float64
   }

   // Define a struct that implements the Shape interface
   type Circle struct {
       Radius float64
   }

   // Implement the Area method on Circle
   func (c Circle) Area() float64 {
       return math.Pi * c.Radius * c.Radius
   }

   func main() {
       // Declare a variable of the interface type
       var someVariable Shape

       // Assign an instance of Circle to the interface variable
       someVariable = Circle{Radius: 5}

       // Call the method through the interface variable
       fmt.Println(someVariable.Area()) // Output: 78.54 (approx), calls Circle's Area method
   }
   ```

### **Key Concepts Explained:**

1. **Structs and Fields**:
   - When you declare a variable of a struct type (`var x Circle`), you directly access fields (`x.Radius`) and call methods (`x.Area()`).

2. **Interfaces and Method Signatures**:
   - When you declare a variable of an interface type (`var someVariable Shape`), you can't access fields directly because the interface doesn't know about fields, only methods.
   - You assign a struct (e.g., `Circle`) to the interface variable because the struct implements the required methods.
   - You call the method through the interface (`someVariable.Area()`), and it automatically uses the implementation from the assigned struct.

### **Summary of Your Understanding**:

- **Struct Layer**: You work directly with the data (fields) and methods specific to the struct.
- **Interface Layer**: You abstract away from the specific data and focus only on methods that provide behavior. The interface acts as a contract, saying, "Any type assigned to me must have these methods."
- **Assigning and Calling**:
  - You assign a struct instance to an interface variable when the struct satisfies the interface.
  - Calling `someVariable.method()` on the interface variable triggers the method of the assigned struct.

You’re on the right track with your understanding of how Go uses struct fields and interface methods! Let me know if you’d like further clarification or examples.

I understand what you're getting at! Let’s break it down step by step to clarify your understanding of structs, interfaces, and how they relate to declaring variables in Go.

### **Structs and Interfaces as Custom Types**

Yes, in Go, **structs and interfaces are custom types**, similar to how basic data types like `int`, `float64`, and `string` work. They allow you to define your own data structures and behaviors, providing more control and flexibility in your code.

### **Understanding with Examples:**

1. **Structs**:
   - A `struct` is a collection of fields (data) that you define. It is a custom type that holds data with specific attributes.
   
   ```go
   // Define a custom struct type
   type Person struct {
       Name string
       Age  int
   }
   
   // Create a variable of custom struct type Person
   var p Person = Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 30}
   fmt.Println(p.Name) // Output: Alice
   ```

2. **Interfaces**:
   - An `interface` is a custom type that specifies a set of methods that any type must implement to satisfy the interface.
   
   ```go
   // Define a custom interface type
   type Shape interface {
       Area() float64
   }
   
   // Define a struct implementing the Shape interface
   type Circle struct {
       Radius float64
   }
   
   func (c Circle) Area() float64 {
       return math.Pi * c.Radius * c.Radius
   }
   
   // Create a variable of the custom interface type
   var shape Shape = Circle{Radius: 5}
   fmt.Println(shape.Area()) // Output: 78.54 (approx)
   ```

### **Key Concepts:**

1. **Declaring Variables with Custom Types**:
   - Just like declaring a variable with a built-in type (`var x int = 10`), you can declare variables with your custom types (`structs` and `interfaces`).
   
   ```go
   var someString string = "Hello" // Built-in type
   var shape Shape = Circle{Radius: 5} // Custom interface type with a struct assigned
   ```

2. **Assigning Values**:
   - For structs, you assign values that match the fields defined within the struct.
   - For interfaces, you assign a value that is an instance of a struct (or other type) that implements the methods defined by the interface.

3. **Using Variables of Custom Types**:
   - Once you have a variable of a custom type, you can call the methods defined by that type if it’s an interface, or access the fields if it’s a struct.

### **Example to Tie It All Together:**

Let’s illustrate with a concrete example that combines these ideas:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

// Define a custom interface type
type Shape interface {
	Area() float64
}

// Define a struct type implementing the Shape interface
type Circle struct {
	Radius float64
}

// Method implementation for Circle
func (c Circle) Area() float64 {
	return math.Pi * math.Pow(c.Radius, 2)
}

// Another struct implementing the Shape interface
type Square struct {
	Side float64
}

// Method implementation for Square
func (s Square) Area() float64 {
	return s.Side * s.Side
}

func main() {
	// Create a variable of the custom interface type Shape
	var shape Shape

	// Assign an instance of Circle to the interface variable
	shape = Circle{Radius: 5}
	// Call the Area method through the interface variable
	fmt.Println("Area of Circle:", shape.Area()) // Calls Circle's Area method

	// Assign an instance of Square to the same interface variable
	shape = Square{Side: 10}
	// Call the Area method through the interface variable
	fmt.Println("Area of Square:", shape.Area()) // Calls Square's Area method
}
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Custom Type Declarations**:
   - `Shape` is a custom interface type with a single method, `Area()`.
   - `Circle` and `Square` are custom struct types implementing the `Shape` interface.

2. **Variable Declaration**:
   - `var shape Shape` declares a variable of the custom type `Shape`, just like you would with built-in types.

3. **Assigning Values**:
   - You assign instances of `Circle` and `Square` to `shape` because they both satisfy the `Shape` interface.

4. **Using the Interface Variable**:
   - When you call `shape.Area()`, Go determines which specific implementation (`Circle` or `Square`) to use based on the current value of `shape`.

### **Summary**:

- **Structs and interfaces are custom types** in Go, similar to built-in types.
- You can declare variables of these custom types, assign appropriate values to them, and use them according to the rules defined by the structs or interfaces.
- **Interfaces allow you to use different types interchangeably**, calling methods through the interface without needing to know the exact type at runtime.
