**Pointer Receivers**:  
    Create a struct `Counter` with a field `value`. Write a method `Increment()` that increases the counter’s value by 1 using a pointer receiver.

---

Your code is almost correct! You've used a pointer receiver, which is the right approach for modifying the `Counter` struct. However, there are just two minor things to address:

1. **Method Naming**: There's a small typo in your method name: `increament` should be `increment` for correct spelling.
   
2. **Return Type**: The method correctly increments the counter and returns the value, but typically, when you increment a counter, you don't necessarily need to return the value unless required by the design. In this case, returning the value is fine, but it's not always necessary for a simple increment operation.

Here's a corrected version of your code with proper method naming:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Counter struct {
	value int
}

// Method to increment the counter using a pointer receiver
func (c *Counter) increment() int {
	c.value += 1
	return c.value
}

func main() {
	increaseValue := Counter{
		value: 10,
	}

	// Calling the increment method
	result := increaseValue.increment()

	fmt.Println(result)
}
```

### Output:
```
11
```

### Key Points:
- You used a pointer receiver (`*Counter`), which allows you to modify the original struct (`c.value += 1`).
- The method `increment()` correctly modifies the `value` field and returns the incremented value.

Your approach is solid. The only change needed was the method name to follow proper spelling. Let me know if you need further clarification!


---

The reason why you're not seeing the counter incrementing from 11 to 12, 13, etc., is because you're only calling the `increment()` method once and then printing the same `result` three times. The method is called just once, and its result is stored in the variable `result`, which stays the same for all three `fmt.Println(result)` calls.

To fix this and see the counter increment with each print, you need to call the `increment()` method each time before printing the result. This way, it will increment the value of `c.value` with each call.

### Corrected Code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type counter struct {
	value int
}

func (c *counter) increment() int {
	c.value += 1
	return c.value
}

func main() {
	increaseValue := counter{
		value: 10,
	}

	// Call increment and print each time
	fmt.Println(increaseValue.increment()) // Output: 11
	fmt.Println(increaseValue.increment()) // Output: 12
	fmt.Println(increaseValue.increment()) // Output: 13
}
```

### Output:
```
11
12
13
```

### Explanation:
- Each time `increaseValue.increment()` is called, it increments the `value` by 1.
- The incremented value is printed immediately after each method call.

Now, each `increment()` call updates the value of the `counter`, and you will see the result changing with each call.
