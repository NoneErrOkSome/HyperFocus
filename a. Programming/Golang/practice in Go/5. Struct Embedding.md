**Struct Embedding**:  
    Define a struct `Employee` with fields `name` and `salary`. Then, define another struct `Manager` that embeds `Employee` and adds a field `department`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Employee struct {
    name   string
    salary float64
}

type Manager struct {
    Employee
    department string
}

func main() {

    em := Employee{
        name:   "Surameta",
        salary: 2000.00,
    }

    man := Manager{
        Employee:   Employee{name: "Tamerasu", salary: 3000.00},
        department: "SWE",
    }

    fmt.Println(em.name, em.salary)
    fmt.Println(man.department, man.name, man.salary)

}
```

Your code is mostly correct, but I noticed a couple of improvements that could be made for better clarity. The structure and logic are good, but when you print the embedded `Employee` struct in the `Manager`, you're printing the entire struct, which may not be what you intend. If you'd like to print specific fields, it's better to reference them directly.

Here’s a refined version of your code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Employee struct {
	name   string
	salary float64
}

type Manager struct {
	Employee
	department string
}

func main() {

	// Employee instance
	em := Employee{
		name:   "Surameta",
		salary: 2000.00,
	}

	// Manager instance that embeds Employee
	man := Manager{
		Employee:   Employee{name: "Tamerasu", salary: 2000.00},
		department: "SWE",
	}

	// Printing Employee fields
	fmt.Println("Employee Name:", em.name)
	fmt.Println("Employee Salary:", em.salary)

	// Printing Manager fields (embedded Employee and Manager's own fields)
	fmt.Println("Manager Name:", man.name) // You can access the embedded Employee's fields directly
	fmt.Println("Manager Salary:", man.salary)
	fmt.Println("Manager Department:", man.department)
}
```

Changes:
1. Accessed `man.name` and `man.salary` directly instead of using `man.Employee` since Go allows direct access to embedded struct fields.
2. The `fmt.Println(man.Employee)` in your version prints the entire `Employee` struct, but printing individual fields is clearer for output.

Let me know if this helps or if you need more clarification!
