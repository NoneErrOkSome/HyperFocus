# **Reinforcement: How the CPU Handles `lw` and `sw` at the Hardware Level**

Now that we understand how registers and memory work in RISC-V, let’s **dive deeper into what happens inside the CPU when executing `lw` (load word) and `sw` (store word)**.

---

## **1️⃣ What Are `lw` and `sw`?**

- **`lw (load word)`** → Fetches a 32-bit (4-byte) value **from memory into a register**.
- **`sw (store word)`** → Writes a 32-bit (4-byte) value **from a register into memory**.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- The CPU **cannot operate directly on memory**.
- Data must be **loaded into registers (`lw`), processed, and stored back (`sw`)** if needed.

## **2️⃣ Step-by-Step Breakdown of `lw` Execution**

### **🔹 What Happens When the CPU Executes `lw a0, 0(a1)`?**

This instruction **loads a word from memory** at the address stored in `a1` and **stores it into `a0`**.

**Execution Steps:**

1. **Address Calculation**
    
    - The CPU reads the base address in `a1` (e.g., `0x1000`).
    - If an **offset is present**, it is added (`lw a0, 4(a1)` means `0x1000 + 4 = 0x1004`).
2. **Memory Access Request**
    
    - The CPU sends a request to the **Memory Access Unit** (part of the CPU).
    - The request asks to **fetch 4 bytes** from the calculated address.
3. **Fetching Data from RAM**
    
    - The **Memory Controller** fetches the data from RAM.
    - The fetched **32-bit value** is placed onto the CPU **data bus**.
4. **Placing Data into the Register**
    
    - The **data bus transfers the value into `a0`**.
    - `a0` now holds the **word from memory**.

📌 **Example: `lw a0, 0(a1)`**

|**Memory Address**|**Value**|
|---|---|
|`0x1000`|`42` (stored as `0x0000002A`)|

✅ After executing `lw a0, 0(a1)`, `a0` contains **42**.

🚨 **Performance Concern:**

- **Memory access is slower than register access**.
- **The CPU stalls if data isn’t immediately available** (cache helps speed this up).

## **3️⃣ Step-by-Step Breakdown of `sw` Execution**

### **🔹 What Happens When the CPU Executes `sw a0, 0(a1)`?**

This instruction **stores the value in `a0` into memory** at the address stored in `a1`.

**Execution Steps:**

1. **Address Calculation**
    
    - The CPU reads `a1` (base address, e.g., `0x1000`).
    - If an **offset is present**, it is added (`sw a0, 4(a1)` means `0x1000 + 4 = 0x1004`).
2. **Memory Access Request**
    
    - The **CPU’s Memory Access Unit** prepares a write request.
    - The **value in `a0` is placed onto the data bus**.
3. **Storing Data in RAM**
    
    - The **Memory Controller** writes the data into the correct address in RAM.

📌 **Example: `sw a0, 0(a1)`**

|**Memory Address**|**Before Execution**|**After Execution**|
|---|---|---|
|`0x1000`|`0x00000000`|`0x0000002A` (42 stored)|

✅ Now, memory at `0x1000` holds **42**.

🚨 **Performance Concern:**

- **Memory writes are slower than register writes**.
- The CPU **may need to wait for memory to be ready** before continuing execution.

## **4️⃣ How the Memory Hierarchy Affects `lw` and `sw`**

Memory access speed depends on the **memory hierarchy**:

|**Memory Type**|**Speed**|**Size**|**Used For**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Registers**|**Fastest (1 cycle)**|**Few KBs**|Immediate calculations|
|**Cache (L1, L2)**|**Very fast (few cycles)**|**MBs**|Recently accessed data|
|**RAM (Main Memory)**|**Slower (50-100 cycles)**|**GBs**|Program data & instructions|

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- **Cache speeds up memory access**—if data is in cache, `lw` is much faster.
- **Direct RAM access is slower**—the CPU may stall waiting for `lw` or `sw`.

## **5️⃣ Memory Alignment & Performance**

### **🔹 What Is Memory Alignment?**

Memory alignment ensures **data is stored at addresses that match its size**.

- **A word (`.word`) should be stored at addresses divisible by 4 (`0x1000, 0x1004, 0x1008`)**.
- **A half-word (`.half`) should be stored at addresses divisible by 2**.

📌 **Misaligned Data Access Issues**

|**Address**|**Access Type**|**Problem?**|
|---|---|---|
|`0x1000`|`lw` (aligned)|✅ Fast, no issue|
|`0x1001`|`lw` (misaligned)|🚨 CPU may need multiple memory accesses|

🚨 **Misaligned loads/stores are slower** because the CPU **needs multiple memory accesses to fetch/store the data correctly**.

✅ **Best Practice:** Always **align data correctly** for better performance.

---

## **6️⃣ Summary**

|**Instruction**|**Purpose**|**Steps Inside the CPU**|
|---|---|---|
|`lw`|Load a word from memory into a register|**Address calculation → Memory request → Data fetched → Stored in register**|
|`sw`|Store a word from a register into memory|**Address calculation → Memory request → Data written to RAM**|

📌 **Final Takeaways:**

- **Memory access (`lw`, `sw`) is slower than register operations**.
- **Proper register usage reduces the need for frequent memory access**.
- **Cache improves performance** by reducing direct RAM access.
- **Misaligned memory access slows down execution**—always align data properly.
