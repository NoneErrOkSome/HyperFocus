# **Reinforcement: How Memory Alignment Affects Performance in RISC-V**

Memory alignment is **critical for performance** in RISC-V because **misaligned memory access slows down execution**. Let’s break down **what memory alignment is, why it matters, and how to optimize it**.

---

## **1️⃣ What Is Memory Alignment?**

Memory alignment means **storing data at memory addresses that match the data size**.

### **🔹 Aligned vs. Misaligned Memory**

|**Data Type**|**Size**|**Aligned Address**|**Misaligned Address**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Byte (`.byte`)**|1 byte|Any address|No issues|
|**Half-word (`.half`)**|2 bytes|Even addresses (`0x1000, 0x1002, 0x1004`)|🚨 `0x1001, 0x1003` (misaligned)|
|**Word (`.word`)**|4 bytes|Addresses divisible by 4 (`0x1000, 0x1004, 0x1008`)|🚨 `0x1001, 0x1002, 0x1003` (misaligned)|

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- **Words (`.word`) must be stored at addresses divisible by 4** for optimal performance.
- **Half-words (`.half`) must be stored at addresses divisible by 2**.
- **Misaligned data forces extra memory accesses, reducing performance**.

---

## **2️⃣ Why Does Misalignment Reduce Performance?**

### **🔹 Aligned Access (Fast)**

If a **word (4 bytes)** is stored at an aligned address (`0x1000`), the CPU can **fetch it in one memory cycle**.

📌 **Example: Aligned Load**

```assembly
.section .data
aligned_var: .word 42  # Stored at address 0x1000
```

✅ **Execution:**

- The CPU reads the **entire 4-byte word in one cycle**.

### **🔹 Misaligned Access (Slow)**

If a **word is stored at `0x1001` (not divisible by 4)**, the CPU **must perform multiple memory accesses**.

📌 **Example: Misaligned Load**

```assembly
.section .data
misaligned_var: .word 42  # Stored at 0x1001 (bad alignment)
```

🚨 **Execution Issue:**

- The CPU **must fetch part of the word from `0x1000` and another part from `0x1004`**.
- **Two memory accesses are needed instead of one**, increasing execution time.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- **Misaligned loads/stores cause additional memory access cycles**, slowing execution.

## **3️⃣ How to Ensure Proper Alignment**

The assembler **automatically aligns `.word` and `.half` data** unless manually overridden.

### **🔹 Using `.align` Directive to Force Alignment**

The `.align N` directive ensures **data starts at an address that is a multiple of `2^N`**.

|**Directive**|**Effect**|
|---|---|
|`.align 1`|Aligns to **2-byte boundary** (for `.half`)|
|`.align 2`|Aligns to **4-byte boundary** (for `.word`)|
|`.align 3`|Aligns to **8-byte boundary** (for `.double`)|

📌 **Example: Enforcing Alignment**

```assembly
.section .data
.align 2      # Ensure the variable is stored at an address divisible by 4
aligned_var: .word 42
```

✅ **Now, `aligned_var` will always be stored at a properly aligned address.**

---

## **4️⃣ How Alignment Affects Performance in Loops**

If a loop accesses misaligned memory, **each iteration will be slower**.

📌 **Example: Slow Loop Due to Misalignment**

```assembly
.section .data
arr: .byte 1, 2, 3, 4, 5  # Misaligned (1-byte elements)

.section .text
.globl _start
_start:
    la a1, arr      # Load array address
    li a2, 5        # Loop counter
loop:
    lb a0, 0(a1)    # Load byte (misaligned access)
    addi a1, a1, 1  # Move to next element
    addi a2, a2, -1 # Decrement counter
    bne a2, zero, loop
```

🚨 **Performance Issue:**

- The **CPU must perform multiple memory accesses per byte**.
- If **word-aligned access (`lw`) was possible, execution would be much faster**.

✅ **Optimized Version (Using Word Alignment)**

```assembly
.section .data
.align 2       # Ensure array is word-aligned
arr: .word 1, 2, 3, 4, 5  # Aligned (4-byte elements)

.section .text
.globl _start
_start:
    la a1, arr      # Load array address
    li a2, 5        # Loop counter
loop:
    lw a0, 0(a1)    # Load word (aligned access)
    addi a1, a1, 4  # Move to next element
    addi a2, a2, -1 # Decrement counter
    bne a2, zero, loop
```

🚀 **Performance Gain:**

- **Each load operation (`lw`) fetches 4 bytes at once**, reducing memory access overhead.
- **The CPU only performs a single memory operation per loop iteration**.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- **Always align arrays to the correct word boundaries** for efficient memory access.

## **5️⃣ Summary: Why Memory Alignment Matters**

|**Alignment**|**Performance**|**Why?**|
|---|---|---|
|**Aligned (Fast)**|✅ 1 memory access|CPU fetches data in **one cycle**|
|**Misaligned (Slow)**|🚨 Multiple memory accesses|CPU needs **extra fetches** to get the full data|

📌 **Final Takeaways:**

- **Align `.word` to addresses divisible by 4** for best performance.
- **Use `.align` directives to enforce proper alignment**.
- **Misaligned memory access slows down execution because the CPU must fetch extra data.**
