# **Reinforcement: How Execution Starts from `_start` in RISC-V**

When a RISC-V program is executed, **where does the CPU begin?** The answer lies in **`_start`**, the **entry point** of the program. Let’s break down what happens when execution begins.

---

## **1️⃣ What Is `_start` in RISC-V?**

- `_start` is the **entry point** where the CPU **begins executing instructions**.
- It is **not a function**, but a **label** that marks the first instruction.
- The linker ensures `_start` is **set as the initial execution address**.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- `_start` is where the CPU jumps when a program begins execution.
- Without `_start`, the program has **no defined entry point**.

---

## **2️⃣ How Does Execution Flow Begin?**

When a RISC-V program starts, the **OS loads it into memory** and hands control to `_start`.

### **🔹 Execution Process Step-by-Step**

1. **The OS loads the program into memory**.
2. **The Program Counter (`PC`) is set to `_start`**.
3. **The CPU begins executing instructions from `_start`**.
4. **The program continues executing sequentially** unless a branch or function call changes the flow.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- **Execution begins at `_start` because the OS sets `PC = _start`.**
- The CPU **fetches the first instruction** from `_start` and begins processing.

---

## **3️⃣ Why Do We Declare `_start` as Global?**

In RISC-V assembly, we write:

```assembly
.global _start
```

This tells the **linker to treat `_start` as the program's entry point**.

📌 **Why is `global` needed?**

- The **assembler alone doesn’t decide where execution starts**.
- The **linker needs `_start` to be globally visible** to set it as the entry point.

✅ **Without `global _start`, the linker won’t know where execution begins.**

---

## **4️⃣ What Happens in `_start`?**

Usually, `_start`:

- Sets up **registers and stack (`sp`)**.
- Calls **the main function** (if there is one).
- Executes **system calls (`ecall`)** for output or program exit.

📌 **Example: Basic `_start` Implementation**

```assembly
.global _start

.section .text
_start:
    li a0, 1       # Load file descriptor (stdout)
    la a1, msg     # Load address of the message
    li a2, 15      # Load message length
    li a7, 64      # Syscall number for write
    ecall          # Call OS to print message

    li a7, 93      # Exit syscall
    ecall

.section .data
msg: .asciz "Hello, RISC-V!\n"
```

✅ **What Happens Here?**

- `_start` **executes first**.
- It **prints a message using a system call (`ecall 64`)**.
- The program **exits using `ecall 93`**.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- `_start` **handles program initialization and execution flow**.
- The OS starts execution **at `_start` because the linker marks it as the entry point**.

---

## **5️⃣ What Happens If `_start` Is Missing?**

🚨 **Without `_start`, the program cannot run!** The linker **won’t know where to begin execution**.

📌 **Error Example (Missing `_start`)**

```sh
ld: warning: cannot find entry symbol _start
```

✅ **Fix:** Add `.global _start` to define the entry point.

## **6️⃣ Summary**

|**Concept**|**Explanation**|
|---|---|
|**`_start`**|The entry point where execution begins.|
|**Why `_start`?**|The OS sets `PC = _start` at launch.|
|**Why `global _start`?**|The linker requires it to set `_start` as the entry point.|
|**What if missing?**|The program won’t execute because `_start` is undefined.|

📌 **Final Takeaway:**

- `_start` is the **first code the CPU executes** in a RISC-V program.
- The OS **sets `PC` to `_start`**, making it the starting point.
- The **linker requires `_start` to be globally defined** to function correctly.
