# **Reinforcement: What Happens if `_start` is Missing in RISC-V?**

The `_start` label is **critical** because it **defines where execution begins**. If `_start` is missing, **the program cannot execute properly**. Let’s break down what happens in this scenario.

---

## **1️⃣ Why Does `_start` Matter?**

- `_start` is the **entry point** where the CPU begins executing instructions.
- The **linker expects `_start` to exist** so it can set the **Program Counter (`PC`)** to this location.
- If `_start` is missing, the program **won’t know where to begin execution**.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- The **OS doesn’t decide where execution starts**—the **linker does**, based on `_start`.

---

## **2️⃣ What Happens If `_start` Is Not Defined?**

If `_start` is missing, **the linker cannot create an executable file**, and you will see an error.

### **🔹 Error Message When `_start` Is Missing**

```sh
ld: warning: cannot find entry symbol _start; defaulting to 0000000000010000
```

✅ **What This Means:**

1. The linker **does not know where to begin execution**.
2. It **defaults to a random memory address** (which likely causes a crash).
3. The program **may not work at all** or execute **invalid instructions**.

🚨 **Key Problem:**

- **Execution starts at an undefined location**, leading to **unpredictable behavior** or **crashes**.

---

## **3️⃣ How to Fix `_start` Not Found**

If you get a **"cannot find entry symbol `_start`"** error, you need to **explicitly define `_start`**.

📌 **✅ Correct Code with `_start`**

```assembly
.global _start   # Define _start as global for the linker

.section .text
_start:
    li a7, 93    # Exit syscall
    li a0, 0     # Exit code (success)
    ecall
```

✅ **Why This Fix Works:**

- The linker **finds `_start` and assigns it as the entry point**.
- The CPU **begins execution at `_start` instead of an undefined location**.

---

## **4️⃣ What If `_start` Exists but Is Not Marked Global?**

If `_start` is defined but **not marked as global**, the linker **still won’t find it**.

📌 **Incorrect Code (Missing `.global _start`)**

```assembly
.section .text
_start:
    li a7, 93
    ecall
```

🚨 **Problem:**

- The assembler processes `_start`, but the **linker doesn’t see it as an entry point**.
- The **OS won’t know where to begin execution**.

✅ **Fix: Add `.global _start`**

```assembly
.global _start
.section .text
_start:
    li a7, 93
    ecall
```

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- **Always use `.global _start`** to make `_start` the entry point.

---

## **5️⃣ What Happens If `_start` Points to Invalid Instructions?**

If `_start` is defined but contains **invalid instructions**, the CPU may execute **nonsense or crash**.

📌 **Example: Undefined Instructions**

```assembly
.global _start
.section .text
_start:
    .word 0xFFFFFFFF  # Invalid instruction (random binary data)
```

🚨 **Problem:**

- The CPU **tries to execute invalid machine code**.
- This leads to **a segmentation fault (`SIGILL`) or undefined behavior**.

✅ **Fix:** Ensure `_start` contains **valid executable instructions**.

---

## **6️⃣ Summary**

|**Problem**|**What Happens?**|**How to Fix It?**|
|---|---|---|
|`_start` is **missing**|**Linker error** (`cannot find entry symbol _start`)|**Define `_start` and make it global** (`.global _start`)|
|`_start` is **not global**|**Linker does not recognize `_start`**|**Add `.global _start`**|
|`_start` **contains invalid instructions**|**CPU executes garbage → crash (`SIGILL`)**|**Ensure `_start` contains valid code**|

📌 **Final Takeaway:**

- **Always define `_start` and mark it global (`.global _start`).**
- **Make sure `_start` contains valid executable instructions.**
- **Without `_start`, the OS won’t know where to begin execution.**
