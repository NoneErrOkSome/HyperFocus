# **Reinforcement: What the Linker Does in RISC-V**

The **linker** plays a critical role in **converting object files into an executable program**. It resolves **addresses, symbols, and dependencies** to create a **self-contained binary that can run on the CPU**.

---

## **1️⃣ What Is the Role of the Linker?**

The **assembler (`as`) converts assembly code into machine code** but leaves **some parts unresolved**, such as:  
✔ **Memory addresses of labels (`_start`, `msg`, etc.)**  
✔ **References to external libraries or other object files**  
✔ **Linking multiple files together into one executable**

The **linker (`ld`) takes object files (`.o`) and resolves these issues, producing an executable**.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- The linker **connects all pieces of a program together** so it can run properly.

---

## **2️⃣ What Exactly Does the Linker Do?**

### **🔹 1. Resolving Symbol Addresses**

A **symbol** is a name representing **a memory location or function** (e.g., `_start`, `msg`).

- The **assembler does not assign actual memory addresses**, it just **marks them as placeholders**.
- The **linker replaces placeholders with real addresses**.

📌 **Example: Symbol Resolution**

```assembly
.section .data
msg: .asciz "Hello"  # Label `msg` points to this memory location
```

✅ The linker assigns an **actual memory address** to `msg`, allowing the program to access it.

---

### **🔹 2. Relocation: Adjusting Memory Addresses**

Each **label and variable** is stored in memory, but **their final addresses are unknown until linking**.

- The **linker relocates symbols** to their correct memory locations.
- This ensures **all references to labels (`la a1, msg`) are updated**.

📌 **Example: Address Adjustment**

```assembly
la a1, msg   # Load address of msg
```

🚨 **Problem (Before Linking):**

- The assembler does not yet know **where `msg` will be located** in memory.

✅ **Solution (After Linking):**

- The linker **fills in the correct memory address**, ensuring correct execution.

---

### **🔹 3. Combining Multiple Object Files**

If a program has **multiple files**, each is assembled separately into `.o` files.

- The **linker merges them into a single executable**.
- It ensures that **functions from different files can call each other correctly**.

📌 **Example: Multiple Object Files**

```sh
riscv64-linux-gnu-as -o file1.o file1.s
riscv64-linux-gnu-as -o file2.o file2.s
riscv64-linux-gnu-ld -o program file1.o file2.o
```

✅ **Key Takeaway:**

- The **linker ensures functions in different files can work together**.

---

### **🔹 4. Including Standard Libraries**

If a program **uses external functions**, such as printing (`printf`) or math functions (`sqrt`),  
the linker **locates and includes the necessary libraries**.

📌 **Example: Linking Against a Library**

```sh
riscv64-linux-gnu-ld -o program program.o -lc
```

✅ **Key Takeaway:**

- The **linker ensures the program has access to external functions** by adding library code.

---

## **3️⃣ What Happens If Linking Fails?**

If the linker **cannot resolve a symbol**, you get an **error**.

📌 **Example Error (Missing `_start`)**

```sh
ld: cannot find entry symbol _start
```

🚨 **Problem:**

- `_start` is missing, so the **linker does not know where to begin execution**.

✅ **Solution:**

- **Add `.global _start`** in the assembly code.

## **4️⃣ Summary: What the Linker Does**

|**Function**|**What It Does**|**Why It’s Important**|
|---|---|---|
|**Symbol Resolution**|Replaces placeholders with real memory addresses|Ensures labels point to correct locations|
|**Relocation**|Adjusts addresses after assembling|Allows flexibility in where code/data is placed|
|**Merging Files**|Combines multiple object files into one program|Allows modular programming|
|**Including Libraries**|Links external functions (e.g., `printf`)|Enables system calls & standard functions|

📌 **Final Takeaway:**

- The **assembler translates instructions** but **doesn’t assign addresses**.
- The **linker resolves memory locations, merges files, and ensures execution correctness**.
