### **Why Do We Need `.global _start`, and What Does It Do?**

The directive **`.global _start`** is **critical** in RISC-V assembly because it tells the **linker** where execution should begin. Without it, the linker **does not know the entry point** of the program.

---

## **1️⃣ What Is `.global _start`?**

- `.global` is an **assembler directive** that **declares a symbol (label) as global**.
- `_start` is the **entry point** of the program.
- The **linker uses `_start` to determine where execution begins**.

📌 **Key Concept:**

- `_start:` is where the CPU **fetches and executes the first instruction**.
- `.global _start` makes `_start` **visible** to the linker.

---

## **2️⃣ Why Do We Need It?**

### **🔹 Without `.global _start`, the Program Won’t Run**

- The **assembler (`as`) converts assembly code into machine code**.
- The **linker (`ld`) combines code and sets the entry point**.
- If `_start` is **not global**, the linker **doesn’t know where to begin execution**.

📌 **Example of a Minimal Program**

```assembly
.section .text
.global _start  # Make _start visible to the linker

_start:
    li a7, 93   # Exit syscall number
    li a0, 0    # Exit status (0 = success)
    ecall       # Execute syscall
```

✅ **This works because `_start` is globally defined.**

---

## **3️⃣ What Happens If We Remove `.global _start`?**

If we **remove `.global _start`**, the assembler may still compile the code, but the linker **won’t know where execution begins**.

📌 **Example Without `.global _start`**

```assembly
.section .text

_start:
    li a7, 93
    li a0, 0
    ecall
```

🔻 **What happens?**

- The **assembler does not complain** (because `_start:` exists).
- The **linker fails** with an error like:
    
    ```
    fatal error: no entry symbol
    ```
    
- The program **cannot execute** because there is **no known entry point**.

---

## **4️⃣ How Does the Linker Use `_start`?**

When linking, the command:

```bash
riscv64-linux-gnu-ld -o program program.o
```

- **Searches for `_start`** as the **program’s entry point**.
- **Sets `_start` as the first instruction** to be executed.

If `_start` is missing, **the linker does not know where the program begins**.

📌 **Equivalent in C**

```c
int main() {
    return 0;
}
```

- In C, **execution always starts at `main()`**.
- In assembly, **execution starts at `_start`**.

## **5️⃣ Summary**

|**Concept**|**Key Details**|
|---|---|
|**`.global _start` is required**|It tells the **linker** where execution begins.|
|**Without it, the program won’t run**|The linker cannot find an entry point.|
|**The linker sets `_start` as the first instruction**|Just like `main()` in C.|
|**Without `_start`, execution cannot begin**|The program will not work properly.|

✅ **Next Step:** Now that we understand why `_start` is needed, we can **move to registers (`a0`, `a1`, etc.) and their role in execution.**

Would you like to **continue into how `a0`, `a1`, and registers are used in assembly execution?** 🚀
