# **Reinforcement: How `ecall` Works at the OS Level in RISC-V**

System calls (`ecall`) allow a **RISC-V program to request services from the operating system (OS)**. Since a user program **cannot directly access hardware**, it must use `ecall` to perform privileged operations like **printing text, reading input, and exiting**.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ What Happens When `ecall` Is Executed?**

When a RISC-V program calls `ecall`, the **CPU switches from user mode to supervisor mode** to let the OS handle the request.

### **üîπ Step-by-Step Breakdown**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Set Up System Call Arguments**

- **Store syscall number in `a7`** (e.g., `64` for `write`, `93` for `exit`).
- **Store function parameters in `a0`, `a1`, `a2`, etc.** (e.g., `a0 = stdout`).

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Execute `ecall`**

- The CPU **triggers a software interrupt** (trap).
- Control transfers from **user mode to supervisor mode** (OS mode).

3Ô∏è‚É£ **OS Handles the System Call**

- The **OS identifies the syscall** using `a7`.
- The **OS performs the requested action** (e.g., writing to the screen).

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Return to User Mode**

- The OS **stores the result in `a0`** (if applicable).
- The CPU **switches back to user mode**, and execution continues.

üìå **Key Takeaway:**

- `ecall` **switches execution to the OS**, allowing access to privileged operations.
- The OS **determines the requested service by checking `a7`**.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ System Call Table in RISC-V**

Each system call **is identified by a number stored in `a7`**.

|**Syscall Number (`a7`)**|**System Call**|**Purpose**|**Parameters (`a0`, `a1`, etc.)**|
|---|---|---|---|
|`64`|`write`|Print to screen|`a0 = fd`, `a1 = address`, `a2 = length`|
|`63`|`read`|Read user input|`a0 = fd`, `a1 = buffer`, `a2 = length`|
|`93`|`exit`|Terminate program|`a0 = exit code`|

üìå **Key Takeaway:**

- **`a7` selects the syscall**, and **`a0`, `a1`, etc., pass parameters**.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Example: How `ecall` Works at the OS Level**

### **üîπ Printing Text (`write` syscall)**

```assembly
.section .data
msg: .asciz "Hello, RISC-V!\n"

.section .text
.global _start

_start:
    li a0, 1      # File descriptor (stdout)
    la a1, msg    # Load address of message
    li a2, 15     # Message length
    li a7, 64     # Syscall number for write
    ecall         # Call OS to print message

    li a7, 93     # Syscall number (exit)
    li a0, 0      # Exit code
    ecall
```

‚úÖ **What Happens at the OS Level?**

1. **User Mode:** The program sets syscall arguments (`a0, a1, a2, a7`).
2. **Switch to Supervisor Mode:** The OS detects `ecall` and executes `write()`.
3. **OS Writes to Screen:** The **message is printed using system I/O**.
4. **Return to User Mode:** Execution continues, leading to `ecall 93` (exit).

üìå **Key Takeaway:**

- **The OS intercepts `ecall` and performs the requested operation.**
- **The CPU switches between user mode and supervisor mode.**

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Example: Reading Input (`read` syscall)**

```assembly
.section .bss
buffer: .space 20  # Reserve 20 bytes for input

.section .text
.global _start

_start:
    li a0, 0      # File descriptor (stdin)
    la a1, buffer # Address of input buffer
    li a2, 20     # Max input length
    li a7, 63     # Syscall number (read)
    ecall         # Call OS to read input

    li a7, 93     # Exit syscall
    li a0, 0      # Exit code
    ecall
```

‚úÖ **What Happens at the OS Level?**

1. **User Mode:** The program requests a read operation (`ecall 63`).
2. **Switch to Supervisor Mode:** The OS **waits for user input**.
3. **OS Reads Data:** The **input is stored in `buffer` in memory**.
4. **Return to User Mode:** Execution continues.

üìå **Key Takeaway:**

- **The OS handles user input securely**, preventing direct hardware access.

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Example: Program Exit (`exit` syscall)**

```assembly
.global _start

_start:
    li a7, 93  # Syscall number (exit)
    li a0, 0   # Exit code (0 = success)
    ecall
```

‚úÖ **What Happens at the OS Level?**

1. **User Mode:** The program sets `a7 = 93` and calls `ecall`.
2. **Switch to Supervisor Mode:** The OS detects `exit`.
3. **OS Cleans Up:** The OS **deallocates memory and closes open files**.
4. **Program Terminates:** The OS **returns to the shell or loader**.

üìå **Key Takeaway:**

- The `exit` syscall **ensures proper program termination**.
- The OS **cleans up resources before exiting**.

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Summary: How `ecall` Works at the OS Level**

|**Step**|**Action**|**Key Process**|
|---|---|---|
|**1. User Mode**|Set syscall number & arguments|Registers (`a7`, `a0`, `a1`, etc.) hold syscall parameters|
|**2. `ecall` Executed**|CPU switches to **supervisor mode**|OS takes control|
|**3. OS Handles Request**|OS performs the requested syscall|Read, write, exit, etc.|
|**4. Return to User Mode**|OS returns control to the program|Execution resumes|

üìå **Final Takeaways:**

- **System calls allow user programs to interact with the OS securely.**
- **The OS handles privileged operations like I/O, memory management, and program termination.**
- **The CPU switches between user mode and supervisor mode when `ecall` is executed.**
