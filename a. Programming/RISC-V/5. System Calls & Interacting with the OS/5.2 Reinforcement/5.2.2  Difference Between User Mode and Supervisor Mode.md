# **Reinforcement: Difference Between User Mode and Supervisor Mode in RISC-V**

RISC-V, like other modern architectures, operates in **different privilege levels** to separate **user programs from the operating system (OS)**. These privilege levels are:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **User Mode (`U-mode`)** ‚Äì Runs application programs.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Supervisor Mode (`S-mode`)** ‚Äì Runs the OS kernel and handles privileged operations.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Machine Mode (`M-mode`)** ‚Äì Used for low-level hardware control (firmware, bootloaders).

For most **Linux-based RISC-V systems**, only **User Mode and Supervisor Mode** are actively used, so we will focus on these two.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ What Are User Mode and Supervisor Mode?**

|**Privilege Level**|**Purpose**|**Allowed Operations**|**Who Uses It?**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**User Mode (`U-mode`)**|Runs normal applications|**Cannot access hardware directly, must use `ecall`**|User programs|
|**Supervisor Mode (`S-mode`)**|Manages memory, processes, I/O|**Handles system calls, memory protection, scheduling**|OS Kernel|

üìå **Key Takeaway:**

- **User Mode (`U-mode`) is restricted**, requiring `ecall` to access system resources.
- **Supervisor Mode (`S-mode`) has full access** and manages system resources.

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ How Does the CPU Switch Between User and Supervisor Mode?**

Switching between **User Mode and Supervisor Mode** happens **when a system call (`ecall`) or an interrupt occurs**.

### **üîπ Step-by-Step Mode Switching**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **User Program Runs in User Mode (`U-mode`)**

- Regular instructions (`add`, `sub`, `lw`, `sw`, etc.) execute normally.
- Direct access to **I/O, memory management, or system functions is blocked**.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **User Program Calls `ecall`**

- The CPU **switches to Supervisor Mode (`S-mode`)**.
- The OS **takes control** to handle the requested service.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **OS Executes System Call in Supervisor Mode (`S-mode`)**

- **Reads syscall number from `a7`**.
- **Performs the requested operation (e.g., writing to screen, reading input)**.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **OS Returns to User Mode (`U-mode`)**

- The **OS finishes execution and switches back** to the user program.
- The user program **resumes execution from the next instruction**.

üìå **Key Takeaway:**

- **User programs cannot perform privileged operations directly**.
- **All system-level tasks must go through `ecall`, forcing a mode switch to `S-mode`.**

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Example: Mode Switching During `ecall`**

### **üîπ Code Example: Print a String Using `ecall`**

```assembly
.section .data
msg: .asciz "Hello, RISC-V!\n"

.section .text
.global _start

_start:
    li a0, 1      # File descriptor (stdout)
    la a1, msg    # Load address of message
    li a2, 15     # Message length
    li a7, 64     # Syscall number (write)
    ecall         # Call OS to print message

    li a7, 93     # Syscall number (exit)
    ecall
```

‚úÖ **What Happens at the OS Level?**

1. **User Mode (`U-mode`) Execution Starts**
    
    - `_start` executes in **User Mode**.
2. **`ecall` Triggers a Supervisor Mode (`S-mode`) Switch**
    
    - `a7 = 64` ‚Üí OS detects `write` syscall.
    - The CPU **switches to Supervisor Mode (`S-mode`)** to execute it.
3. **OS Handles System Call in Supervisor Mode**
    
    - The OS **writes `"Hello, RISC-V!\n"` to stdout**.
4. **OS Returns to User Mode (`U-mode`)**
    
    - The program **continues execution in User Mode**.

üìå **Key Takeaway:**

- The program **starts in User Mode**.
- **`ecall` forces a switch to Supervisor Mode**.
- The OS **executes the request and switches back to User Mode**.

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Why Does RISC-V Use Privilege Levels?**

Separating **User Mode (`U-mode`) and Supervisor Mode (`S-mode`)** improves **security and stability**.

### **üîπ Reasons for Using Separate Modes**

|**Reason**|**User Mode (`U-mode`)**|**Supervisor Mode (`S-mode`)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Security**|Prevents users from accessing OS memory|Protects system resources|
|**Stability**|Prevents accidental modification of hardware|Allows controlled system execution|
|**Process Isolation**|Each program is isolated from others|OS enforces protection|

üìå **Key Takeaway:**

- **User programs cannot interfere with OS execution**.
- **Supervisor Mode prevents unauthorized access to system resources**.

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ What Happens If a User Program Tries to Perform a Privileged Operation?**

If a **User Mode (`U-mode`) program tries to execute a privileged instruction**, the CPU generates a **trap (exception).**

### **üîπ Example: Attempting a Privileged Instruction in User Mode**

```assembly
.global _start

_start:
    csrr a0, sstatus  # Try to read a privileged CSR register
```

üö® **What Happens?**

- Since `sstatus` (Supervisor Status Register) **is restricted**, the CPU **triggers an exception**.
- The OS **terminates the program with a fault**.

‚úÖ **Key Takeaway:**

- **Only the OS can access privileged resources**.
- **User programs must use `ecall` to interact with system functions.**

---

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Summary**

|**Feature**|**User Mode (`U-mode`)**|**Supervisor Mode (`S-mode`)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Who Runs Here?**|User programs|OS kernel|
|**Privilege Level**|Limited|Full system control|
|**Access to Memory & I/O**|‚ùå No direct access|‚úÖ Full access|
|**Mode Switching?**|Uses `ecall` to request OS services|Returns to User Mode after syscall|
|**Fault Handling?**|OS prevents unauthorized access|OS handles system errors|

üìå **Final Takeaway:**

- **User Mode (`U-mode`) is restricted**, preventing direct access to hardware.
- **Supervisor Mode (`S-mode`) has full control**, managing system execution.
- **System calls (`ecall`) trigger mode switching**, allowing safe OS interaction.
