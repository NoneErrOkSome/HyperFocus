# **Reinforcement: How System Calls Are Processed by the OS in RISC-V**

A **system call (`ecall`)** is a **request from a user program** to the operating system (OS) for performing privileged tasks like **I/O operations, memory allocation, and process management**. In this section, we will break down how **the OS handles system calls internally**.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ What Happens Internally When `ecall` Is Executed?**

When a program calls `ecall`, the CPU **switches from user mode (`U-mode`) to supervisor mode (`S-mode`)** to allow the OS to handle the request.

### **üîπ Step-by-Step Breakdown**

|**Step**|**Action**|**Who Handles It?**|
|---|---|---|
|**1. User Program Sets Up System Call**|The program loads `a7` with a syscall number and sets arguments in `a0, a1, a2...`|**User Program (U-mode)**|
|**2. Execute `ecall`**|The CPU detects `ecall` and raises a software interrupt|**CPU (Mode Switch)**|
|**3. Switch to Supervisor Mode (`S-mode`)**|The OS takes control and reads `a7` to identify the syscall type|**Operating System (S-mode)**|
|**4. OS Executes the Requested System Call**|The OS performs the requested action (e.g., writing to stdout)|**Operating System (S-mode)**|
|**5. OS Stores Return Value in `a0`**|If the syscall has a return value, the OS places it in `a0`|**Operating System (S-mode)**|
|**6. OS Returns Control to User Mode (`U-mode`)**|The CPU switches back to user mode and resumes execution|**CPU (Mode Switch)**|

üìå **Key Takeaway:**

- `ecall` **triggers a controlled CPU mode switch**, allowing the OS to **handle privileged operations safely**.
- The OS **identifies the syscall using `a7` and executes the requested function**.
- After handling the request, **control is returned to the user program**.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Example: Processing a `write` System Call (`ecall 64`)**

A program calling `write` to print text:

```assembly
.section .data
msg: .asciz "Hello, RISC-V!\n"

.section .text
.global _start

_start:
    li a0, 1      # File descriptor (stdout)
    la a1, msg    # Address of the message
    li a2, 15     # Length of the message
    li a7, 64     # Syscall number for write
    ecall         # Call OS to print message

    li a7, 93     # Syscall number (exit)
    ecall
```

‚úÖ **What Happens at the OS Level?**

1. **User Mode: Program Sets Up System Call**
    
    - `a0 = 1` (stdout), `a1 = msg` (address), `a2 = 15` (length), `a7 = 64` (write syscall).
2. **CPU Detects `ecall` ‚Üí Switches to Supervisor Mode**
    
    - The OS takes control and reads `a7 = 64` ‚Üí Identifies the syscall as `write`.
3. **OS Executes `write`**
    
    - The OS retrieves the **message from memory** and sends it to the **stdout device driver**.
4. **OS Returns to User Mode**
    
    - The OS places the return value (`number of bytes written`) in `a0` and **switches back to User Mode (`U-mode`)**.

üìå **Key Takeaway:**

- The **OS handles output requests safely** without allowing direct hardware access.
- The **CPU mode switch ensures security**‚Äîuser programs cannot modify system resources directly.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Example: Processing a `read` System Call (`ecall 63`)**

A program calling `read` to get user input:

```assembly
.section .bss
buffer: .space 20  # Reserve 20 bytes for input

.section .text
.global _start

_start:
    li a0, 0      # File descriptor (stdin)
    la a1, buffer # Address of buffer
    li a2, 20     # Max input length
    li a7, 63     # Syscall number (read)
    ecall         # Call OS to read input

    li a7, 93     # Exit syscall
    ecall
```

‚úÖ **What Happens at the OS Level?**

1. **User Mode: Program Requests Input (`ecall 63`)**
    
    - `a0 = 0` (stdin), `a1 = buffer` (address), `a2 = 20` (max bytes), `a7 = 63` (read syscall).
2. **CPU Detects `ecall` ‚Üí Switches to Supervisor Mode**
    
    - The OS takes control and reads `a7 = 63` ‚Üí Identifies the syscall as `read`.
3. **OS Waits for Input**
    
    - The OS waits for the user to enter text and **stores it in `buffer` at `a1`**.
4. **OS Returns to User Mode**
    
    - The OS places the **number of bytes read** in `a0` and **switches back to User Mode (`U-mode`)**.

üìå **Key Takeaway:**

- **User input handling is done by the OS**, ensuring security.
- The **CPU switches to Supervisor Mode to execute privileged operations**.

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ How Does the OS Identify the System Call?**

The OS **reads `a7`** to determine which syscall to execute.

üìå **System Call Table**

|**Syscall Number (`a7`)**|**System Call**|**Purpose**|**Registers Used (`a0, a1...`)**|
|---|---|---|---|
|`64`|`write`|Print to screen|`a0 = fd`, `a1 = address`, `a2 = length`|
|`63`|`read`|Read user input|`a0 = fd`, `a1 = buffer`, `a2 = length`|
|`93`|`exit`|Terminate program|`a0 = exit code`|

‚úÖ **Key Takeaway:**

- The OS **uses `a7` to look up the correct system call function**.
- **Arguments are passed in `a0, a1, a2`** for the syscall function to use.

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ What If a Program Uses an Invalid `ecall`?**

If an **invalid syscall number is placed in `a7`**, the OS **throws an exception**.

üìå **Example: Invalid `ecall`**

```assembly
li a7, 999  # Invalid syscall number
ecall        # Causes OS error
```

üö® **What Happens?**

- The OS **detects that syscall 999 does not exist**.
- It **terminates the program with an error message**.

‚úÖ **Key Takeaway:**

- **Only valid syscalls (defined in the OS) can be executed**.

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Summary: How System Calls Are Processed by the OS**

|**Step**|**Action**|**Who Handles It?**|
|---|---|---|
|**1. User Program Calls `ecall`**|Registers `a7`, `a0`, `a1` set|**User Mode (`U-mode`)**|
|**2. CPU Triggers Mode Switch**|`ecall` ‚Üí Supervisor Mode (`S-mode`)|**CPU (Mode Switch)**|
|**3. OS Reads `a7`**|Identifies syscall (`write`, `read`, `exit`)|**Operating System (`S-mode`)**|
|**4. OS Executes Syscall**|Handles requested operation|**Operating System (`S-mode`)**|
|**5. OS Returns to User Mode**|CPU switches back|**CPU (Mode Switch)**|

üìå **Final Takeaway:**

- **User programs request OS services via `ecall`**, passing syscall numbers in `a7`.
- **The CPU switches to Supervisor Mode (`S-mode`) to execute the request.**
- **The OS completes the operation and switches back to User Mode (`U-mode`).**
