# **10.3 Masking and Setting Specific Bits in RISC-V**

**Bit masking** is a technique used to **manipulate specific bits** in a binary number. It is useful for:  
✔ **Checking if a bit is set**  
✔ **Setting a specific bit to `1`**  
✔ **Clearing a specific bit to `0`**  
✔ **Toggling (flipping) a bit**

---

## **1️⃣ What Is a Bit Mask?**

A **bit mask** is a binary value used with **bitwise operations (`AND`, `OR`, `XOR`)** to **isolate or modify specific bits** in another number.

📌 **Common Masking Techniques:**

|**Operation**|**Bitwise Operator**|**Effect**|
|---|---|---|
|**Checking if a bit is set**|`AND (&)`|Keeps only the bit we check|
|**Setting a bit to `1`**|`OR (|)`|
|**Clearing a bit to `0`**|`AND (&)` with NOT (`~`)|Forces a bit to `0`|
|**Toggling a bit**|`XOR (^)`|Flips the bit (0 → 1, 1 → 0)|

---

## **2️⃣ Checking If a Specific Bit Is Set (`AND` Masking)**

To check if **bit `N` is set**, use `AND` with a **bit mask that has only that bit set to `1`**.

📌 **Example: Checking if Bit 2 Is Set in `0b1010` (10)**

```
   10   =  00001010
   Mask =  00000100  (Bit 2 set)
-------------------
AND     =  00000000  (Result = 0, bit is NOT set)
```

📌 **RISC-V Assembly**

```assembly
li a0, 10      # Load number 10 (0b1010)
li a1, 4       # Load bit mask 0b00000100 (bit 2)
and a2, a0, a1 # Check if bit 2 is set
```

✅ **If `a2 == 0`, bit is NOT set. If `a2 != 0`, bit is set.**

📌 **Key Takeaway:**  
✔ `AND` **isolates specific bits** to check their state.

---

## **3️⃣ Setting a Specific Bit (`OR` Masking)**

To **force bit `N` to `1`**, use `OR` with a **bit mask that has that bit set to `1`**.

📌 **Example: Setting Bit 2 in `0b00000010` (2)**

```
   2    =  00000010
   Mask =  00000100  (Bit 2 set)
-------------------
OR      =  00000110  (Result = 6)
```

📌 **RISC-V Assembly**

```assembly
li a0, 2       # Load number 2 (0b00000010)
li a1, 4       # Load bit mask 0b00000100 (bit 2)
or a2, a0, a1  # Set bit 2
```

✅ **Result:** `a2 = 6 (0b00000110)`, bit 2 is now `1`.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**  
✔ `OR` **sets specific bits without affecting others**.

---

## **4️⃣ Clearing a Specific Bit (`AND` with NOT Masking)**

To **force bit `N` to `0`**, use `AND` with a **bit mask that has all `1s` except the bit to clear (`0`)**.

📌 **Example: Clearing Bit 2 in `0b00000110` (6)**

```
   6    =  00000110
   Mask =  11111011  (Bit 2 cleared)
-------------------
AND     =  00000010  (Result = 2)
```

📌 **RISC-V Assembly**

```assembly
li a0, 6       # Load number 6 (0b00000110)
li a1, -5      # Load mask 0b11111011 (-5 in two’s complement)
and a2, a0, a1 # Clear bit 2
```

✅ **Result:** `a2 = 2 (0b00000010)`, bit 2 is now `0`.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**  
✔ **Use `AND` with an inverted bit mask to clear bits.**

---

## **5️⃣ Toggling a Specific Bit (`XOR` Masking)**

To **flip bit `N` (0 → 1, 1 → 0)**, use `XOR` with a **bit mask that has that bit set to `1`**.

📌 **Example: Toggling Bit 2 in `0b00000110` (6)**

```
   6    =  00000110
   Mask =  00000100  (Bit 2 set)
-------------------
XOR     =  00000010  (Result = 2)
```

📌 **RISC-V Assembly**

```assembly
li a0, 6       # Load number 6 (0b00000110)
li a1, 4       # Load bit mask 0b00000100 (bit 2)
xor a2, a0, a1 # Toggle bit 2
```

✅ **Result:** `a2 = 2 (0b00000010)`, bit 2 is now toggled.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**  
✔ **Use `XOR` to toggle bits without affecting others.**

## **6️⃣ Summary: Masking and Setting Specific Bits in RISC-V**

|**Operation**|**Instruction**|**Effect**|
|---|---|---|
|**Check if bit is set**|`AND` (`&`)|Keeps only the bit being checked|
|**Set a specific bit**|`OR` (`|`)|
|**Clear a specific bit**|`AND` (`&`) with `NOT (~)`|Forces a bit to `0`|
|**Toggle a bit**|`XOR` (`^`)|Flips the bit (0 → 1, 1 → 0)|

📌 **Final Takeaways:**

- **Use `AND` to check if a bit is set.**
- **Use `OR` to set a bit.**
- **Use `AND` with `~` (inverted mask) to clear a bit.**
- **Use `XOR` to toggle a bit.**
