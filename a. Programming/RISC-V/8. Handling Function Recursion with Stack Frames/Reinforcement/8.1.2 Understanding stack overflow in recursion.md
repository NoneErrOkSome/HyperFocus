# **8.1.2 Understanding Stack Overflow in Recursion (Reinforcement)**

## **1️⃣ What Is Stack Overflow in Recursion?**

A **stack overflow** occurs when the **stack memory runs out of space** due to too many recursive calls. Since **each recursive call creates a new stack frame**, excessive recursion **exceeds the stack limit**, causing the program to crash.

📌 **Key Causes of Stack Overflow:**

- **Missing or incorrect base case** → Recursion never stops.
- **Too many recursive calls** → The stack grows beyond memory limits.
- **Inefficient recursion** → Too much data is stored unnecessarily in each frame.

---

## **2️⃣ How Stack Overflow Happens in RISC-V**

Each function call **allocates stack space** using:

```assembly
addi sp, sp, -8  # Allocate stack frame
sw ra, 4(sp)     # Save return address
sw a0, 0(sp)     # Save argument
```

Each recursive call **keeps pushing new stack frames**, leading to **uncontrolled stack growth**.

---

## **3️⃣ Stack Overflow Example: Infinite Recursion**

Let’s look at **a broken factorial function** without a base case.

### **📌 Faulty Code Without a Base Case**

```assembly
.global _start

_start:
    li a0, 3       # Compute factorial(3)
    jal factorial  # Call factorial function

    li a7, 93      # Exit syscall
    ecall

factorial:
    addi sp, sp, -8  # Allocate stack frame
    sw ra, 4(sp)     # Save return address
    sw a0, 0(sp)     # Save function argument

    addi a0, a0, -1  # Decrease n (Recursive Case)
    jal factorial    # Calls itself recursively (NO BASE CASE!)

    lw ra, 4(sp)     # Restore return address
    addi sp, sp, 8   # Free stack frame
    ret              # Return to caller
```

🔴 **What’s Wrong?**

- **No base case:** Function **never stops calling itself**.
- **Stack keeps growing:** Each call **allocates more memory**, leading to overflow.
- **Eventually crashes** when memory is exhausted.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- **Every recursion must have a stopping condition.**
- **Without a base case, stack frames will keep adding indefinitely.**

---

## **4️⃣ How Stack Overflow Looks in Memory**

If `factorial(100000)` is called, **each call creates a new stack frame**.

📌 **Recursive Stack Growth Until Overflow**

```
Call factorial(100000) → Allocates Stack Frame
    ├── Call factorial(99999) → Allocates Stack Frame
        ├── Call factorial(99998) → Allocates Stack Frame
            ├── (Stack keeps growing...)
                ├── Stack Overflow! (Memory limit reached)
```

🔴 **Program crashes when it runs out of memory.**

---

## **5️⃣ Detecting & Avoiding Stack Overflow**

### **📌 How to Detect Stack Overflow**

- **The program crashes with an "illegal instruction" or segmentation fault.**
- **Registers and stack pointer (`sp`) stop behaving as expected.**
- **Function never returns, or the program runs indefinitely.**

### **📌 Ways to Prevent Stack Overflow**

✔ **Always include a base case.**  
✔ **Use tail recursion optimization (TCO) if possible.**  
✔ **Limit recursion depth for large inputs.**  
✔ **Convert deep recursion into iteration when possible.**

---

## **6️⃣ Corrected Recursive Function with Base Case**

```assembly
factorial:
    addi sp, sp, -8  # Allocate stack frame
    sw ra, 4(sp)     # Save return address
    sw a0, 0(sp)     # Save function argument

    li t0, 1
    beq a0, t0, base_case  # Base Case: if n == 1, return 1

    addi a0, a0, -1  # Reduce n
    jal factorial    # Recursive call

    lw t1, 0(sp)     # Load saved n
    mul a0, a0, t1   # Multiply result with n

base_case:
    lw ra, 4(sp)     # Restore return address
    addi sp, sp, 8   # Free stack space
    ret              # Return to caller
```

✅ **Now recursion stops when `n == 1`.**  
✅ **Stack space is properly managed.**

## **7️⃣ Summary: Avoiding Stack Overflow in Recursion**

|**Concept**|**Key Idea**|
|---|---|
|**Stack overflow occurs when recursion is uncontrolled**|Too many recursive calls without stopping.|
|**Missing base cases cause infinite recursion**|Always include a base case (`if (n == 1)`).|
|**Each recursive call uses stack space**|More calls = More stack memory used.|
|**Fix: Add a base case & optimize recursion**|Ensure recursion stops at some point.|

📌 **Final Takeaways:**

- **Always include a base case to prevent infinite recursion.**
- **Uncontrolled recursion leads to stack overflow and program crashes.**
- **Optimize recursion by reducing stack usage and using iteration when needed.**
