# **Reinforcement: What Happens During Assembling, Linking, and Execution?**

Now that we understand the **stages of assembling, linking, and execution**, let’s go deeper into what **actually happens at each step**.

---

## **1️⃣ The Assembling Stage (`.s → .o` – Assembly to Object Code)**

The **assembler** converts human-readable **assembly code into machine code**.

### **🔹 What Happens in Assembling?**

- **Lexical Analysis** → The assembler reads the text (`.s` file) and recognizes instruction mnemonics (`add`, `lw`, `ecall`).
- **Parsing & Syntax Checking** → Ensures the assembly syntax is valid.
- **Opcode Translation** → Each instruction is converted into its **binary representation** (machine code).
- **Symbol Table Creation** → Labels (e.g., `_start`, `msg`) are recorded but **not yet resolved to actual memory addresses**.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- The assembler **does not determine memory locations** yet.
- The `.o` file **contains machine code but has unresolved symbols (addresses not assigned).**

---

## **2️⃣ The Linking Stage (`.o → Executable`)**

The **linker** combines object files and resolves memory addresses, producing an **executable binary**.

### **🔹 What Happens in Linking?**

- **Symbol Resolution** → Converts labels (`_start`, `msg`) into **actual memory addresses**.
- **Relocation** → Adjusts addresses to fit into **the program’s memory layout**.
- **Merging Multiple Object Files** → If there are **multiple `.o` files**, they are combined into a single executable.
- **Adding Standard Library Code** → Includes necessary startup code and system call stubs.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- The linker **makes the program self-contained** so it can execute.
- The **output is a fully executable file** that can be loaded into memory.

---

## **3️⃣ Execution Stage (`./program` – OS Loads and Runs the Binary)**

Once the program is executed, the **OS loads it into memory and starts execution**.

### **🔹 What Happens in Execution?**

- **OS Allocates Memory** → The OS reserves space for **code, stack, and data**.
- **Program Counter (`PC`) is Set** → `_start` (entry point) is loaded into `PC`, and execution begins.
- **CPU Fetches, Decodes, Executes Instructions**
- **System Calls (`ecall`) Trigger OS Functions**
- **Program Terminates (`ecall 93`)**

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- Execution starts when the **OS loads the program into memory** and **hands control to the CPU**.
- The CPU **executes each instruction sequentially** unless there is branching or function calls.

## **4️⃣ Memory Layout After Execution**

When the OS loads a RISC-V program, it organizes memory as follows:

|**Memory Segment**|**Purpose**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|**Text Section**|Stores machine code (instructions)|`_start: add a0, a1, a2`|
|**Data Section**|Stores initialized global/static variables|`msg: .asciz "Hello"`|
|**BSS Section**|Stores uninitialized global/static variables|`buffer: .space 20`|
|**Heap**|Used for dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`)|-|
|**Stack**|Stores local variables & function call data|Function parameters, return addresses|

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- The **text section contains executable instructions**.
- The **stack grows downward**, and the **heap grows upward**.
- The OS **ensures memory isolation** so the program does not overwrite OS memory.

---

## **5️⃣ Summary**

|**Stage**|**Action**|**Key Process**|
|---|---|---|
|**Assembling**|Converts assembly to object code (`.o`)|**Opcode translation, symbol table creation**|
|**Linking**|Resolves addresses, merges files|**Symbol resolution, relocation**|
|**Execution**|OS loads program, CPU runs instructions|**Memory allocation, `PC` set, fetch-decode-execute cycle**|

📌 **Final Takeaways:**

- The **assembler converts assembly code into machine code but does not resolve addresses**.
- The **linker assigns addresses and produces an executable**.
- The **OS loads the program into memory, sets `PC`, and starts execution**.
