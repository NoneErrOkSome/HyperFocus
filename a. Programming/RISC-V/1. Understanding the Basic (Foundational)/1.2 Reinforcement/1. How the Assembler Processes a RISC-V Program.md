# **Reinforcement: How the Assembler Processes a RISC-V Program**

This section explains how a **RISC-V assembly program is processed** from source code to execution.

---

## **1️⃣ Overview of the Compilation Process**

A RISC-V program **does not run directly from assembly code**. It must go through several steps:

1. **Writing the assembly code** → (`.s` file, e.g., `program.s`)
2. **Assembling** → Converts assembly (`.s`) into machine code (`.o`)
3. **Linking** → Combines multiple object files into an executable
4. **Loading into memory** → OS prepares the program for execution
5. **Execution by the CPU** → CPU fetches and executes instructions

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- The **assembler translates human-readable assembly** into **machine code**.
- The **linker combines dependencies** and **resolves memory addresses**.
- The **CPU executes instructions** only after loading the binary into memory.

## **2️⃣ Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Process**

### **🔹 Step 1: Writing the Assembly Code**

A basic **RISC-V assembly program** (`program.s`) looks like this:

```assembly
.section .data
msg: .asciz "Hello, RISC-V!\n"

.section .text
.global _start

_start:
    li a0, 1       # File descriptor (stdout)
    la a1, msg     # Load address of message
    li a2, 15      # Message length
    li a7, 64      # Syscall number (write)
    ecall          # Call OS to print message

    li a7, 93      # Exit syscall
    ecall
```

✅ **What Happens in This Step?**

- The **program is written in human-readable assembly**.
- The **assembler cannot execute this directly**—it must be converted into machine code.

---

### **🔹 Step 2: Assembling (`.s` → `.o`)**

The assembler **translates assembly into machine code** and outputs an **object file (`.o`)**.

**Command to Assemble:**

```sh
riscv64-unknown-elf-as -o program.o program.s
```

✅ **What Happens in This Step?**

- The assembler **converts each instruction into binary machine code**.
- It **does not yet create an executable**—only raw object code.
- Labels (e.g., `_start`) are not yet resolved into memory addresses.

---

### **🔹 Step 3: Linking (`.o` → Executable)**

The linker **resolves memory addresses** and combines multiple object files into an executable (`a.out`).

**Command to Link:**

```sh
riscv64-unknown-elf-ld -o program program.o
```

✅ **What Happens in This Step?**

- The **linker assigns actual memory addresses** to labels (e.g., `_start`).
- It **includes necessary libraries or startup code**.
- Produces a **fully executable file (`program`)**.

📌 **Why is Linking Necessary?**

- In assembly, **labels are placeholders**, but the CPU needs **actual memory addresses**.
- The **linker resolves all addresses and references** before execution.

---

### **🔹 Step 4: Loading into Memory**

When you run `./program`, the OS **loads the program into memory**:

✅ **What Happens in This Step?**

- The OS **allocates memory** and **loads the binary into RAM**.
- The **entry point (`_start`) is placed in the Program Counter (`PC`)**.
- The CPU **fetches the first instruction** from memory.

---

### **🔹 Step 5: Execution by the CPU**

The CPU follows the **fetch-decode-execute cycle**:

6. **Fetch** → Reads the instruction from memory (`PC` → instruction register).
7. **Decode** → Identifies the instruction type and operands.
8. **Execute** → Performs the operation (e.g., `add`, `lw`, `sw`, `ecall`).
9. **Repeat** → Moves to the next instruction (`PC += 4`).

✅ **What Happens in This Step?**

- The CPU **executes instructions one by one**.
- When it reaches `ecall`, it **makes a system call to the OS**.
- The program **runs until it reaches `exit` (`li a7, 93 → ecall`)**.

## **3️⃣ Summary of the Assembler Process**

|**Stage**|**Action**|**Command**|**Output File**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**1. Writing**|Write assembly code|`program.s`|`.s` file|
|**2. Assembling**|Convert to machine code|`as -o program.o program.s`|`.o` file|
|**3. Linking**|Resolve addresses & create executable|`ld -o program program.o`|Executable|
|**4. Loading**|OS loads into memory|`./program`|Process in memory|
|**5. Execution**|CPU fetches and runs instructions|-|Running program|

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- **The assembler only translates assembly into raw machine code.**
- **The linker makes the program executable by resolving memory addresses.**
- **The CPU executes instructions one at a time.**
