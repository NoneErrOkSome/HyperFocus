# **Jumping Instructions in RISC-V**

Jumping instructions **unconditionally change execution flow**, allowing programs to **skip** instructions, **call functions**, or **return** from them. Unlike **branching instructions**, which depend on conditions, **jumping always occurs** when executed.

---

## **1️⃣ What Are Jumping Instructions?**

Jumping instructions allow a program to **move execution to another memory address**, either **directly** (absolute jump) or **relative** (jump based on register values).

📌 **Why Use Jumping Instructions?**

- **To implement function calls and returns.**
- **To create loops (when combined with branches).**
- **To avoid redundant instructions (skip unnecessary operations).**

✅ **Key Takeaway:**

- **Jumping instructions always execute, unlike branches, which are conditional.**

## **2️⃣ Types of Jumping Instructions in RISC-V**

RISC-V provides **three primary jump instructions**:

|**Instruction**|**Purpose**|**How It Works?**|
|---|---|---|
|`j label`|**Unconditional jump**|Jumps directly to `label`|
|`jal label`|**Function call (Jump and Link)**|Jumps to `label` and saves return address in `ra`|
|`jalr rd, rs, imm`|**Indirect jump (Jump and Link Register)**|Jumps to an address stored in `rs + imm` and saves return address in `rd`|

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- `j` is **used for simple jumps**.
- `jal` is **used for function calls** (stores return address).
- `jalr` is **used for indirect jumps (jumping to dynamic addresses)**.

---

## **3️⃣ How Does an Unconditional Jump Work?**

The simplest jump is **`j label`**, which **always transfers execution to `label`**.

📌 **Example: Skipping Instructions**

```assembly
li a0, 10  
j skip      # Jump over the next instruction
li a0, 20   # This instruction is skipped

skip:
```

✅ **What Happens?**

- The **CPU skips `li a0, 20`** and jumps directly to `skip`.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- `j` **is useful for skipping unnecessary instructions**.

---

## **4️⃣ How Does `jal` Work for Function Calls?**

The `jal` (**Jump and Link**) instruction **jumps to a function and stores the return address in `ra` (x1)**.

📌 **Example: Function Call Using `jal`**

```assembly
jal function   # Jump to 'function' and store return address in ra
li a0, 5       # This instruction executes after the function returns

function:
    li a1, 10  # Function body
    ret        # Return (jumps back using 'ra')
```

✅ **What Happens?**

1. **`jal function` jumps to `function`**.
2. **Return address (`ra`) stores the instruction after `jal`**.
3. **After executing `function`, `ret` jumps back using `ra`**.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- `jal` is **essential for function calls** because it remembers **where to return**.

---

## **5️⃣ How Does `jalr` Work for Indirect Jumps?**

The `jalr` (**Jump and Link Register**) instruction **jumps to an address stored in a register** instead of a fixed label.

📌 **Example: Jumping to an Address in a Register**

```assembly
la t0, function   # Load address of function into t0
jalr ra, t0, 0    # Jump to address in t0 and save return address in ra

function:
    li a1, 10     # Function body
    ret           # Return using 'ra'
```

✅ **What Happens?**

- Instead of jumping to a hardcoded `label`, `jalr` **jumps to the address in `t0`**.
- This is useful for **function pointers, dynamic function calls, or jump tables**.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- `jalr` allows **jumping to dynamically stored addresses**, useful for **function pointers**.

---

## **6️⃣ Example: Using Jumps in a Loop**

Jumping instructions can be used **with branches to create loops**.

📌 **Example: Loop Using `j` and `bge`**

```assembly
li t0, 0     # i = 0
li t1, 5     # Limit (5)

loop:
    bge t0, t1, end_loop  # If i >= 5, exit loop
    addi t0, t0, 1        # i++
    j loop                # Jump back to loop

end_loop:
```

✅ **How It Works?**

4. `bge t0, t1, end_loop` **checks if `i >= 5`**.
5. If not, `addi t0, t0, 1` increments `i`, and `j loop` jumps back.
6. When `i == 5`, execution continues after `end_loop`.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- `j` **repeats execution**, making it useful for **loops**.

---

## **7️⃣ Summary: How Jumping Instructions Work**

|**Instruction**|**Purpose**|**Use Case**|
|---|---|---|
|`j label`|**Unconditional jump**|Skip instructions, repeat loops|
|`jal label`|**Jump and store return address**|Function calls|
|`jalr rd, rs, imm`|**Jump to address in `rs + imm`**|Indirect jumps (function pointers)|

📌 **Final Takeaways:**

- **Jumping is always executed, unlike branching (conditional).**
- **`jal` is used for function calls because it saves the return address.**
- **`jalr` is used for jumping to dynamic addresses, useful for function pointers.**
