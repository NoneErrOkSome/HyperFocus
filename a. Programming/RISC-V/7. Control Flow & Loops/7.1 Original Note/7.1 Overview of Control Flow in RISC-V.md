# **7.1 Overview of Control Flow in RISC-V**

Control flow in RISC-V **determines the execution order of instructions**. Unlike high-level languages where control flow is managed using `if` statements, loops, and function calls, **assembly requires explicit instructions** to handle these structures.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ What Is Control Flow?**

Control flow defines **how the CPU decides which instruction to execute next**.

- **By default, execution is sequential** (instructions execute in order).
- **Control flow instructions allow jumping to different parts of the program**.

üìå **Key Takeaway:**

- Without control flow, **programs would execute one instruction after another without decision-making**.
- Control flow **enables branching, loops, and function calls**.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Control Flow Instructions in RISC-V**

Control flow is managed through **three main types of instructions**:

|**Type**|**Purpose**|**Instructions Used**|
|---|---|---|
|**Branching**|**Conditional execution**|`beq`, `bne`, `blt`, `bge`, `bltu`, `bgeu`|
|**Jumping**|**Unconditional execution change**|`j`, `jal`, `jalr`|
|**Function Calls & Returns**|**Call and return from functions**|`jal`, `jalr`, `ret`|

üìå **Key Takeaway:**

- **Branching controls execution based on conditions.**
- **Jumping allows direct changes in execution flow.**
- **Function calls allow structured program execution.**

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Sequential Execution vs. Control Flow**

By default, instructions execute **one after another** like this:

```assembly
addi a0, a0, 1  # Increment a0
addi a1, a1, 2  # Increment a1
addi a2, a2, 3  # Increment a2
```

‚úÖ **Each instruction executes one after another** because there's **no branch or jump**.

üö® **With control flow, execution can change conditionally or unconditionally:**

```assembly
beq a0, a1, label  # Branch to 'label' if a0 == a1
j end              # Jump to 'end' unconditionally
label:
  add a0, a0, a1   # This executes only if a0 == a1
end:
```

‚úÖ **Here, execution may jump depending on conditions or directly skip instructions.**

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Why Is Control Flow Important?**

Control flow **allows programs to make decisions and repeat tasks**, enabling:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Conditional execution** (e.g., `if-else` statements).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Loops** (e.g., `for`, `while` loops).  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Function calls** to **modularize** code.

üìå **Key Takeaway:**

- Without control flow, programs would be **static** and **non-interactive**.

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Summary**

|**Concept**|**Key Idea**|
|---|---|
|**Sequential Execution**|Instructions execute one after another|
|**Branching (`beq`, `bne`, etc.)**|Controls execution based on conditions|
|**Jumping (`j`, `jal`)**|Unconditionally changes execution flow|
|**Function Calls (`jal`, `ret`)**|Enables modular code execution|

üìå **Final Takeaway:**

- Control flow **allows dynamic execution, making programs flexible and functional**.
- **Next, we explore branching and looping in detail.**
