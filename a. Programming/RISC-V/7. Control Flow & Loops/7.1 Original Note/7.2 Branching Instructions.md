# **Branching Instructions in RISC-V**

Branching instructions **allow a program to change execution flow based on conditions**. Instead of executing instructions sequentially, the CPU can **jump to different locations in memory** depending on the values stored in registers.

---

## **1️⃣ What Are Branching Instructions?**

Branching instructions compare values in registers and **conditionally jump** to a different part of the program.

### **🔹 Why Use Branching?**

- **To implement `if` conditions** (execute code only when a condition is met).
- **To create loops** (repeated execution until a condition is false).
- **To handle error checking** (exit if an error condition occurs).

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- **Branching makes decision-making possible in assembly**.

## **2️⃣ Types of Branching Instructions in RISC-V**

|**Instruction**|**Condition Checked**|**Purpose**|
|---|---|---|
|`beq rs1, rs2, label`|`rs1 == rs2`|Branch if equal|
|`bne rs1, rs2, label`|`rs1 != rs2`|Branch if not equal|
|`blt rs1, rs2, label`|`rs1 < rs2`|Branch if less than (signed)|
|`bge rs1, rs2, label`|`rs1 >= rs2`|Branch if greater or equal (signed)|
|`bltu rs1, rs2, label`|`rs1 < rs2`|Branch if less than (unsigned)|
|`bgeu rs1, rs2, label`|`rs1 >= rs2`|Branch if greater or equal (unsigned)|

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- **Signed instructions (`blt`, `bge`) interpret values as signed integers**.
- **Unsigned instructions (`bltu`, `bgeu`) treat values as non-negative**.

---

## **3️⃣ How Does Branching Work?**

Each branch instruction **compares two registers** and **jumps** if the condition is met.

📌 **Example: `beq` (Branch if Equal)**

```assembly
li a0, 5
li a1, 5
beq a0, a1, equal_label  # If a0 == a1, jump to equal_label
```

✅ **What Happens?**

- Since `a0` **equals** `a1`, execution **jumps to `equal_label`**.

---

## **4️⃣ Signed vs. Unsigned Branching**

Branching can be **signed or unsigned**, which affects comparisons.

📌 **Example: `blt` vs. `bltu` (Signed vs. Unsigned Comparison)**

```assembly
li a0, -1
li a1, 2
blt a0, a1, signed_less  # -1 < 2 (Signed) → Branch taken

li a0, 0xFFFFFFFF  # Unsigned 4294967295
li a1, 2
bltu a0, a1, unsigned_less  # 4294967295 < 2 (Unsigned) → NOT taken
```

✅ **Why This Matters?**

- Signed comparisons **treat `-1` as smaller than `2`**.
- Unsigned comparisons **treat `0xFFFFFFFF` (4294967295) as larger than `2`**.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- **Use signed (`blt`, `bge`) for signed numbers**.
- **Use unsigned (`bltu`, `bgeu`) for non-negative values**.

## **5️⃣ Example: Implementing `if-else` in Assembly**

📌 **High-Level Code (`C` Equivalent)**

```c
if (a == b) {
    result = 10;
} else {
    result = 20;
}
```

📌 **RISC-V Assembly Equivalent**

```assembly
li a0, 5
li a1, 5
beq a0, a1, if_equal   # If a0 == a1, jump to if_equal
li a2, 20              # Else case (set result to 20)
j end_if

if_equal:
    li a2, 10          # If case (set result to 10)

end_if:
```

✅ **How It Works?**

1. If `a0 == a1`, execution **jumps to `if_equal`** and sets `a2 = 10`.
2. Otherwise, execution **skips to `end_if`**, setting `a2 = 20`.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- **Branching implements `if` statements using labels and jumps**.

---

## **6️⃣ Example: Implementing Loops in Assembly**

📌 **High-Level Code (`C` Equivalent)**

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    sum += i;
}
```

📌 **RISC-V Assembly Equivalent**

```assembly
li t0, 0     # i = 0
li t1, 5     # Limit (5)
li t2, 0     # sum = 0

loop:
    bge t0, t1, end_loop  # If i >= 5, exit loop
    add t2, t2, t0        # sum += i
    addi t0, t0, 1        # i++
    j loop                # Repeat

end_loop:
```

✅ **How It Works?**

1. `t0` is the loop counter, initialized to `0`.
2. `bge t0, t1, end_loop` checks if `t0` has reached `5`.
3. If not, `t2` is updated (`sum += i`), and `t0` is incremented (`i++`).
4. The loop **repeats** until `t0 == 5`, then execution moves to `end_loop`.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- **Loops are implemented using conditional branches (`bge`, `bne`, etc.) and jumps (`j`).**

## **7️⃣ Summary: How Branching Works in RISC-V**

|**Concept**|**Key Idea**|
|---|---|
|**Branching controls program flow**|Jumps to a label if a condition is met|
|**Signed vs. Unsigned Comparisons**|Use `blt`, `bge` for signed, `bltu`, `bgeu` for unsigned|
|**`if-else` is implemented with `beq` and `bne`**|Jumps to different parts of the program|
|**Loops use branch + jump (`bge`, `j`)**|Allows repeated execution|

📌 **Final Takeaway:**

- **Branching is essential for decision-making and loops in RISC-V.**
- **Use the right instruction (`blt` vs. `bltu`) to avoid signed/unsigned errors.**
