# **Reinforcement: What Happens Inside the CPU When Executing an Instruction?**

Now that we understand the **fetch-decode-execute cycle**, let’s break down **what happens inside the CPU at a deeper level** when it processes instructions.

---

## **1️⃣ The CPU’s Internal Components**

Before understanding instruction execution, let’s look at the key components inside the CPU that handle instructions:

|**Component**|**Purpose**|
|---|---|
|**Program Counter (`PC`)**|Stores the address of the next instruction to execute.|
|**Instruction Register (`IR`)**|Holds the fetched instruction before decoding.|
|**Control Unit (CU)**|Decodes instructions and generates control signals.|
|**Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**|Performs arithmetic and logic operations.|
|**Register File**|Stores values temporarily for fast processing.|
|**Memory Access Unit**|Fetches/stores data from/to memory (RAM).|

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- The **Control Unit (CU)** decodes instructions and controls execution.
- The **ALU** performs arithmetic, logic, and comparisons.
- The **Memory Access Unit** handles `lw` and `sw` operations.

## **2️⃣ Step-by-Step Execution of an Instruction**

When an instruction is executed, the CPU follows **five detailed steps** internally:

### **🔹 Step 1: Instruction Fetch (Retrieving the Instruction)**

1. The **PC (Program Counter) holds the address** of the instruction to execute.
2. The **instruction is fetched from memory** and placed into the **Instruction Register (IR)**.
3. The **PC is incremented (`PC += 4`)** to point to the next instruction.

✅ **Example: Fetching `add a0, a1, a2`**

- `PC = 0x1000`
- The CPU **fetches instruction at `0x1000` from memory**.
- The instruction is stored in `IR`.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- The instruction is **retrieved from memory** before being decoded.

---

### **🔹 Step 2: Instruction Decode (Understanding the Operation)**

4. The **Control Unit (CU) reads the instruction** stored in `IR`.
5. It **identifies the opcode** (e.g., `add`, `lw`, `sw`, `beq`).
6. It **determines the source and destination registers**.

✅ **Example: Decoding `add a0, a1, a2`**

- **Opcode:** `0110011` → R-type (register-based operation).
- **Operands:** `a0` (destination), `a1`, `a2` (source registers).

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- The Control Unit **interprets the instruction** and **prepares the ALU or memory unit** for execution.

---

### **🔹 Step 3: Operand Fetch (Reading Data from Registers)**

7. If the instruction **requires registers**, the CPU **retrieves values** from the **Register File**.
8. If it’s a **memory instruction (`lw`)**, the CPU **prepares the memory access unit**.

✅ **Example: Fetching Operands for `add a0, a1, a2`**

- `a1` holds `10`
- `a2` holds `5`
- These values are **loaded into the ALU**.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- Registers provide **faster access** than memory, reducing execution time.

---

### **🔹 Step 4: Execute (Performing the Operation)**

9. If it's an **arithmetic instruction (`add`, `sub`, `mul`)**, the ALU **performs the computation**.
10. If it's a **memory instruction (`lw`, `sw`)**, the **Memory Access Unit reads/writes data**.
11. If it's a **branch instruction (`beq`, `bne`)**, the **PC is updated** based on the condition.

✅ **Example: Executing `add a0, a1, a2`**

- ALU computes `a0 = a1 + a2` → `a0 = 10 + 5 = 15`
- The result (`15`) is **temporarily held before being written back**.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- The ALU **executes arithmetic** or **performs comparisons for branching**.

---

### **🔹 Step 5: Write Back (Storing the Result)**

12. If the instruction **modifies a register**, the result is **stored back into the Register File**.
13. If it’s a **memory operation (`sw`)**, the result is **written to RAM**.

✅ **Example: Writing `add a0, a1, a2` Result**

- `a0` now stores `15` (result of `10 + 5`).

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- Results are **stored either in registers (`add`, `sub`) or in memory (`sw`)**.

---

## **3️⃣ What Happens in Each Execution Type?**

### **🔹 Arithmetic Operations (`add`, `sub`, `mul`)**

- Operands are **loaded from registers** into the ALU.
- The **ALU performs the computation**.
- The result is **stored back into a register**.

### **🔹 Memory Operations (`lw`, `sw`)**

- **Memory Address Calculation:** The CPU **computes the memory address** (`base register + offset`).
- **Data Transfer:** The Memory Access Unit **fetches or writes data**.
- **Data is stored in a register (`lw`) or memory (`sw`)**.

### **🔹 Branching (`beq`, `bne`, `blt`)**

- **Condition Evaluation:** The CPU **compares registers**.
- **PC Update:** If the condition is met, `PC` is updated **to a new address** (jumping).

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- **Arithmetic uses registers and the ALU.**
- **Memory instructions interact with RAM.**
- **Branching changes execution flow by modifying `PC`.**

## **4️⃣ Summary: What Happens Inside the CPU**

|**Step**|**Action**|**Key Process**|
|---|---|---|
|**1. Fetch**|Get instruction from memory|`PC` → `Instruction Register (IR)`|
|**2. Decode**|Identify operation & operands|Control Unit (CU) deciphers opcode|
|**3. Operand Fetch**|Retrieve data from registers/memory|Read registers or prepare memory access|
|**4. Execute**|Perform arithmetic/memory operation|ALU computes or Memory Unit accesses RAM|
|**5. Write Back**|Store result in register/memory|Register File or RAM stores the output|

📌 **Final Takeaways:**

- The CPU **processes instructions in five steps** (Fetch → Decode → Fetch Operands → Execute → Write Back).
- The **Control Unit handles decoding**, and the **ALU performs arithmetic operations**.
- **Branching modifies `PC`**, and **memory instructions interact with RAM**.
