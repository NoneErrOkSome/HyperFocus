# **Reinforcement: How the CPU Fetches and Decodes Instructions in RISC-V**

Now that we understand how a RISC-V program is **assembled, linked, and executed**, let‚Äôs focus on **how the CPU processes instructions** at the hardware level.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ The Instruction Cycle (Fetch-Decode-Execute)**

The **CPU processes instructions in three main stages**:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Fetch** ‚Üí The CPU **reads** the next instruction from memory.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Decode** ‚Üí The CPU **interprets** what the instruction does.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Execute** ‚Üí The CPU **performs the operation** (arithmetic, memory access, branching, etc.).

üìå **Key Takeaway:**

- The CPU **repeats this cycle for every instruction**, moving from one to the next.

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Instruction Cycle**

### **üîπ Step 1: Fetch (Instruction Retrieval)**

1. The **Program Counter (`PC`) holds the address of the next instruction**.
2. The CPU **fetches the instruction from memory** using the `PC`.
3. The **PC is incremented** to point to the next instruction.

üìå **Example:** If `PC = 0x1000`, the CPU fetches the instruction stored at `0x1000`.

- If the instruction is `add a0, a1, a2`, the CPU **retrieves its binary representation** from memory.
- The `PC` is then updated (`PC += 4` in RV32I, since instructions are 4 bytes).

‚úÖ **Key Takeaways:**

- **All instructions are stored in memory** in binary form.
- **The `PC` ensures instructions are executed in order.**
- **Jump/branch instructions modify `PC`, causing non-sequential execution.**

---

### **üîπ Step 2: Decode (Instruction Interpretation)**

Once the CPU fetches an instruction, it **decodes the binary format** to understand:

4. **What type of instruction it is** (arithmetic, memory access, branching, etc.).
5. **Which registers are involved** (e.g., `add a0, a1, a2` means `a0 = a1 + a2`).
6. **Whether the instruction requires memory access** (`lw`, `sw`).

üìå **Example: Decoding a RISC-V Instruction** The instruction `add a0, a1, a2` in binary:

```
0000000 00101 00100 000 00010 0110011  
```

**Decoded Information:**

- **Opcode:** `0110011` ‚Üí R-type instruction (register-based)
- **Function (Operation):** `000` ‚Üí `add`
- **Destination Register (`rd`):** `a0` (`00010` in binary)
- **Source Register 1 (`rs1`):** `a1` (`00100`)
- **Source Register 2 (`rs2`):** `a2` (`00101`)

‚úÖ **Key Takeaways:**

- **The CPU reads opcode bits to determine the instruction type.**
- **Operands (registers, immediates) are extracted from instruction encoding.**
- **The decoded data tells the CPU what operation to execute.**

---

### **üîπ Step 3: Execute (Performing the Operation)**

Once the instruction is decoded, the CPU **performs the necessary operation**:

- **Arithmetic:** Executes `add`, `sub`, `mul`, etc.
- **Memory Access:** Reads (`lw`) or writes (`sw`) data from/to memory.
- **Branching:** Modifies `PC` if a condition is met (`beq`, `bne`, `blt`).

üìå **Example: Executing `add a0, a1, a2`**

7. **Fetch:** Read instruction from memory (`PC = 0x1000`).
8. **Decode:** Identify `add` operation with operands `a0, a1, a2`.
9. **Execute:** Compute `a0 = a1 + a2` and store the result in `a0`.

‚úÖ **Key Takeaways:**

- The **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) performs the actual computation**.
- **For memory operations (`lw`, `sw`), the CPU interacts with RAM**.
- **For branches (`beq`), the CPU updates `PC` if the condition is met.**

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Special Cases in Execution**

### **üîπ How Does the CPU Handle Branching?**

Branching instructions (`beq`, `bne`, `blt`, `bge`) **change the execution flow** by modifying `PC`.

üìå **Example: `beq a0, a1, label`**

- If `a0 == a1`, the `PC` is updated to `label`.
- If not, execution continues sequentially (`PC += 4`).

‚úÖ **Key Takeaways:**

- Branching **disrupts sequential execution** by modifying `PC`.
- The CPU **compares register values before deciding to jump**.

---

### **üîπ How Does the CPU Handle Memory Operations (`lw`, `sw`)?**

- **For `lw (load word)`:**
    
    1. The CPU sends a **memory request** to fetch data from RAM.
    2. The data is **loaded into a register** (`lw a0, 0(a1)`).
- **For `sw (store word)`:**
    
    1. The CPU **writes a register‚Äôs value into memory** (`sw a0, 0(a1)`).

‚úÖ **Key Takeaways:**

- The CPU **accesses memory through `lw` and `sw`, not directly**.
- Memory access **takes longer than register operations** (registers are inside the CPU, memory is external).

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Summary: The Complete Instruction Cycle**

|**Stage**|**Action**|**Key Process**|
|---|---|---|
|**Fetch**|Read instruction from memory|`PC` points to the next instruction|
|**Decode**|Identify instruction type and operands|Opcode is translated into operation|
|**Execute**|Perform the operation|ALU computes, memory is accessed if needed|

üìå **Final Takeaways:**

- **The CPU processes instructions one at a time in fetch-decode-execute cycles.**
- **Arithmetic is executed instantly, while memory access requires extra steps.**
- **Branching modifies `PC`, changing the execution flow.**

# **What Is the Program Counter (`PC`) in RISC-V?**

The **Program Counter (PC)** is a **special register** inside the CPU that **stores the address of the next instruction to be executed**. It plays a **critical role** in ensuring that the program runs sequentially, instruction by instruction.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Role of the Program Counter (`PC`)**

### **üîπ What Does `PC` Do?**

- **Stores the memory address of the next instruction** to be executed.
- **Automatically updates** after each instruction.
- **Controls the program flow** (modifies when jumps or branches occur).

üìå **Key Takeaway:**

- The CPU **fetches instructions** from memory based on the value of `PC`.
- **Normal execution:** `PC` moves to the next instruction (`PC += 4`).
- **Branching or jumping:** `PC` is modified to point to a different instruction.

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ How `PC` Changes During Execution**

The **Program Counter updates differently based on the type of instruction being executed**:

|**Instruction Type**|**What Happens to `PC`?**|
|---|---|
|**Sequential Execution**|`PC += 4` (move to the next instruction)|
|**Branch (`beq`, `bne`)**|`PC = label` (if condition is met)|
|**Jump (`jal`, `jalr`)**|`PC = target_address`|
|**System Call (`ecall`)**|`PC` moves to OS code, then returns|

üìå **Example: Normal Execution (PC Increases by 4)**

```
PC = 0x1000  ‚Üí Fetch instruction at 0x1000  
PC = 0x1004  ‚Üí Fetch instruction at 0x1004  
PC = 0x1008  ‚Üí Fetch instruction at 0x1008  
```

‚úÖ **Takeaway:** `PC` normally increases by **4 bytes** (each RISC-V instruction is 4 bytes long).

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ How `PC` Works with Branching**

When a **branch instruction (`beq`, `bne`) is executed**, `PC` **jumps** to a different memory location.

üìå **Example: `beq` (Branch if Equal)**

```assembly
_start:
    li a0, 5
    li a1, 5
    beq a0, a1, jump_here   # If a0 == a1, PC changes

    # This instruction is skipped if PC jumps
    li a0, 10   

jump_here:
    li a1, 20
```

‚úÖ **What Happens?**

- If `a0 == a1`, `PC` **jumps to `jump_here`**, skipping the `li a0, 10` instruction.
- If `a0 != a1`, `PC` **continues normally** (`PC += 4`).

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ How `PC` Works with Function Calls (`jal`, `ret`)**

Function calls modify `PC` so execution jumps to a function and then **returns** after it finishes.

üìå **Example: Function Call (`jal` ‚Üí Jump and Link)**

```assembly
.globl _start

_start:
    li a0, 5
    jal my_function  # Jump to function (PC changes)
    li a1, 20        # This runs AFTER function returns

my_function:
    add a0, a0, a0  # a0 = a0 * 2
    ret             # Return to caller (PC restores previous location)
```

‚úÖ **What Happens?**

- `jal my_function` **jumps** to `my_function`, modifying `PC`.
- When `ret` is executed, `PC` **returns to the instruction after `jal`**.

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Summary**

|**Concept**|**What Happens?**|
|---|---|
|**PC (Program Counter)**|Stores the memory address of the next instruction|
|**Normal Execution**|`PC += 4` (next instruction)|
|**Branching (`beq`, `bne`)**|`PC = label` (jumps if condition is met)|
|**Jump (`jal`, `ret`)**|`PC` changes to function address and returns after execution|

üìå **Key Takeaway:**

- `PC` **tracks instruction execution** and updates automatically.
- **Branching and jumps modify `PC`**, changing execution flow.
- **System calls (`ecall`) temporarily transfer control to the OS.**
