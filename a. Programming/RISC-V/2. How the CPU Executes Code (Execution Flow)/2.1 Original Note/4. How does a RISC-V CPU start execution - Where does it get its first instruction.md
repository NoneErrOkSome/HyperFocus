### **How Does a RISC-V CPU Start Execution? Where Does It Get Its First Instruction?**

A RISC-V CPU **starts execution** immediately after power-on or reset. However, it does **not automatically know** what program to run. Instead, it follows a strict **boot sequence** to locate and execute the first instruction.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Power-On Reset (POR) & CPU Initialization**

When a RISC-V system is powered on or reset:

1. **The CPU starts at a fixed memory address** (the **reset vector**).
2. **The Program Counter (PC) is set to this address**.
3. **The CPU fetches the first instruction from this memory address** and executes it.

üìå **Key Concept: The Reset Vector**

- The **reset vector** is a pre-defined memory address where execution begins.
- The address **depends on the system implementation** but is typically:
    - **`0x00001000`** (if booting from ROM)
    - **`0x80000000`** (if booting from RAM)

üìå **CPU Behavior at Reset:**

- Sets the **Program Counter (PC)** to the reset vector.
- Initializes registers (`x0` is always `0`, others may be undefined).
- Begins fetching and executing instructions from memory.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Where Does the CPU Get Its First Instruction?**

The **first instruction** comes from **ROM (Read-Only Memory)** or **Boot Flash Memory**, depending on the system:

### **üîπ Scenario 1: Embedded Systems (ROM Boot)**

- In simple embedded systems, **firmware is stored in ROM** (non-volatile memory).
- The CPU fetches its first instruction **directly from ROM** at a fixed address.

üìå **Example Boot Process for Embedded Systems:**

4. CPU starts at **`0x00001000`**.
5. Executes bootloader code stored in ROM.
6. Bootloader loads the actual program from flash memory or peripheral storage.
7. Transfers control to the loaded program.

---

### **üîπ Scenario 2: General-Purpose Computers (RAM Boot via Bootloader)**

- In more complex systems (e.g., Linux on RISC-V), the CPU starts with a **bootloader** in ROM.
- The **bootloader's job** is to:
    - Initialize memory and hardware.
    - Load the main operating system (OS) from storage (flash, disk, network).
    - Transfer control to the OS.

üìå **Example Boot Process for a Linux System:**

8. CPU starts at **`0x80000000`** (ROM bootloader location).
9. Bootloader initializes memory and CPU state.
10. Bootloader loads the OS kernel into RAM.
11. Bootloader jumps to the kernel‚Äôs entry point.
12. The OS takes over and begins execution.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Execution Flow: Step by Step**

|**Step**|**Action**|
|---|---|
|**1Ô∏è‚É£ Power On**|The CPU resets and starts execution at the **reset vector** (e.g., `0x80000000`).|
|**2Ô∏è‚É£ Fetch First Instruction**|The CPU reads the **first instruction** from ROM.|
|**3Ô∏è‚É£ Execute Bootloader**|If present, the bootloader initializes hardware and loads the OS.|
|**4Ô∏è‚É£ Transfer Control**|The bootloader jumps to the main program (OS kernel or user program).|
|**5Ô∏è‚É£ OS Takes Over**|The OS manages CPU execution and loads user applications.|

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ What Happens If There‚Äôs No Bootloader?**

- If no valid bootloader or program is found in ROM, the CPU **may hang** or enter a **failure state**.
- Some systems fall back to a **debug mode** (waiting for code to be loaded manually via JTAG or serial).

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Summary**

|**Concept**|**Key Details**|
|---|---|
|**CPU Reset**|The CPU starts execution at a fixed address (reset vector).|
|**First Instruction**|Typically comes from **ROM** (boot firmware).|
|**Bootloader**|Loads and executes the operating system (OS).|
|**Execution Flow**|CPU ‚Üí Bootloader ‚Üí OS ‚Üí User Programs.|
