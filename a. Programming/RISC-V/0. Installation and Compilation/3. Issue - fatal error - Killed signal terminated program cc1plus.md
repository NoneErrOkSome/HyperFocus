### **Issue: `fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus`**

Your build failed with:

```
fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus
make[2]: *** [Makefile:2596: insn-output.o] Error 1
```

This usually happens when:

1. **Your system runs out of RAM** → The kernel **kills the process**.
2. **WSL does not have enough allocated memory** → You need to adjust the memory allocation.

## **🚀 Fix: Increase Available Memory for WSL**

Since you're using **WSL**, you need to manually **increase the available RAM**.

### **Step 1: Edit WSL Configuration**

1. Open **PowerShell (on Windows)** and run:
    
    ```powershell
    notepad $env:USERPROFILE\.wslconfig
    ```
    
2. Add (or modify) these lines:
    
    ```ini
    [wsl2]
    memory=8GB   # Adjust to 8GB (or 4GB if you have less RAM)
    processors=4 # Use at least 4 CPU cores
    swap=8GB     # Enable swap space
    ```
    
3. Save and close **Notepad**.

### **Step 2: Restart WSL**

4. Open **PowerShell** and restart WSL:
    
    ```powershell
    wsl --shutdown
    wsl
    ```
    

---

### **Step 3: Restart the Build**

After restarting WSL, go back to **your Debian terminal** and retry:

```bash
cd ~/riscv-gnu-toolchain
make -j$(nproc)
```

🔹 If `make -j$(nproc)` **still fails**, try reducing the number of parallel jobs:

```bash
make -j2
```

💡 **Why?** This reduces the CPU/memory load.

## **📌 Final Step: Verify Installation**

Once the build completes, **check if `riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc` exists**:

```bash
which riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc --version
```

✅ If this works, **you are done!** 🎉

|**Issue**|**Fix**|
|---|---|
|**`fatal error: Killed signal`**|**WSL ran out of RAM → Increase memory in `.wslconfig`**|
|**`riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc: command not found`**|**Build failed → Restart WSL and rebuild**|
