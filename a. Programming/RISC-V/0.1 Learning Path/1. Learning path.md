If I were to **rearrange and rephrase** your questions in a structured way for a **true beginner’s learning path**, here’s how I would organize them:

---

### **1️⃣ Understanding the Basics (Foundational Questions)**

1. **What is the basic structure of a RISC-V assembly program?**  
    → (Before asking about directives and system calls, understand the general layout.)
2. **What is the syntax of RISC-V? How are instructions written?**  
    → (Understand how to write valid assembly code.)
3. **What are directives in assembly, and why do we use them?**  
    → (Before understanding system calls, know how `.section`, `.global`, etc., work.)

---

### **2️⃣ How the CPU Executes Code (Execution Flow)**

4. **How does a RISC-V CPU start execution? Where does it get its first instruction?**  
    → (Before thinking about `.global _start`, understand how execution begins.)
5. **What is the relationship between CPU and memory in assembly execution?**  
    → (Understand where instructions and data are stored before accessing variables.)

---

### **3️⃣ Minimum Requirements to Run a Program**

6. **What is the absolute minimum needed to run a RISC-V assembly program?**  
    → (Before working with data or printing, learn what a minimal valid program is.)
7. **Why do we need `.global _start`, and what does it do?**  
    → (Once you know the minimum, understand why `_start` is necessary.)

---

### **4️⃣ Registers & Data Storage (Before System Calls)**

8. **What are `a0`, `a1`, etc., and why do we use them?**  
    → (Before using `ecall`, understand registers and how they store data.)
9. **How do I declare a variable and assign a value in RISC-V?**  
    → (Before printing or modifying variables, know how to store them in memory.)
10. **Why can `0` be used multiple times in assembly? What is `x0`?**  
    → (Before seeing `li a0, 0` in many places, understand why `x0` is special.)

---

### **5️⃣ System Calls & Interacting with the OS**

1. **What are system calls (`ecall`), and how do they work in RISC-V?**  
    → (Now that registers and memory are understood, learn how programs talk to Linux.)
2. **What is the difference between directives and system calls?**  
    → (Understand what is assembler-level and what is OS-level.)

---

### **Where to Go Next After These Questions?**

🔹 **Basic Arithmetic in Assembly** (How do you add, subtract, multiply, and store values?)  
🔹 **Loading & Storing Data in Memory** (How does `lw`, `sw`, `la` work?)  
🔹 **Branching & Conditions** (`beq`, `bne`, `blt`—how to make decisions in code?)  
🔹 **Loops & Function Calls** (Once comfortable with instructions, move to control flow.)
