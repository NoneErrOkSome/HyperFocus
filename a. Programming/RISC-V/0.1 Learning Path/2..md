Now that we've covered the **fundamentals of RISC-V assembly**, the next structured learning topics are:

---

### **1️⃣ Basic Arithmetic in Assembly**

🔹 **Question:** _How do you perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in RISC-V?_  
→ (Learn how `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div` work with registers and memory.)

---

### **2️⃣ Loading & Storing Data in Memory**

🔹 **Question:** _How do `lw`, `sw`, and `la` work for accessing and storing values in memory?_  
→ (Understand memory access using load and store instructions.)

---

### **3️⃣ Branching & Conditions (Decision Making)**

🔹 **Question:** _How do conditional branching instructions like `beq`, `bne`, and `blt` work in RISC-V?_  
→ (Learn how to make decisions based on comparisons.)

---

### **4️⃣ Loops & Function Calls (Control Flow)**

🔹 **Question:** _How do you implement loops and function calls in RISC-V?_  
→ (Learn how `jal`, `ret`, and loop conditions work.)

### **Where Would You Like to Start?** 🚀

Would you like to begin with **basic arithmetic (`add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`)**, or would you prefer to start with **memory access (`lw`, `sw`, `la`)?**
