# **Reinforcement: How Signed and Unsigned Numbers Work in RISC-V**

In RISC-V, **signed and unsigned numbers are represented differently**, and arithmetic operations **behave differently based on whether numbers are treated as signed or unsigned**. Let’s dive deeper into how they work.

---

## **1️⃣ How Are Numbers Stored in Registers?**

All numbers in RISC-V registers are stored as **binary values**, but the interpretation depends on whether they are **signed (can be negative) or unsigned (only positive)**.

|**Number Type**|**Range (RV32I - 32-bit)**|**Range (RV64I - 64-bit)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Signed Integer (`int`)**|`-2^31` to `2^31 - 1` (`-2147483648` to `2147483647`)|`-2^63` to `2^63 - 1`|
|**Unsigned Integer (`uint`)**|`0` to `2^32 - 1` (`0` to `4294967295`)|`0` to `2^64 - 1`|

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- **Signed integers use two’s complement representation** to store negative numbers.
- **Unsigned integers do not have negative values and use the full bit range for positive values.**

---

## **2️⃣ Signed Numbers: Two’s Complement Representation**

RISC-V uses **two’s complement** to represent signed numbers.

- The **most significant bit (MSB) is the sign bit**:
    - `0` → Positive
    - `1` → Negative

📌 **Example: Storing `-5` in Two’s Complement (8-bit Example)**

```
 5  =  0000 0101  (Binary)
-5  =  1111 1011  (Two’s Complement)
```

✅ **Why Two’s Complement?**

- **Arithmetic is the same for positive and negative numbers** (no special logic needed).
- **Negative numbers naturally wrap around**, making overflow predictable.

🚨 **Overflow Example (32-bit Signed Addition)**

```assembly
li a0, 2147483647   # Max signed 32-bit int (2^31 - 1)
addi a0, a0, 1      # Causes overflow → wraps to -2147483648
```

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- **Signed numbers wrap around on overflow.**

---

## **3️⃣ Unsigned Numbers: No Negative Values**

Unsigned numbers **use all bits for positive values**, so the range **starts from `0`** and extends to `2^n - 1`.

🚨 **Unsigned Overflow Example (32-bit)**

```assembly
li a0, 0xFFFFFFFF   # Max unsigned 32-bit value (2^32 - 1)
addi a0, a0, 1      # Causes overflow → wraps to 0
```

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- **Unsigned numbers wrap around from `2^n - 1` to `0` when overflowing.**

---

## **4️⃣ Signed vs. Unsigned Arithmetic Operations**

Some instructions treat numbers as **signed**, while others treat them as **unsigned**.

### **🔹 Addition and Subtraction (`add`, `sub`)**

- **`add` and `sub`** treat numbers **as signed**.
- **`addu` and `subu`** (if implemented) would treat numbers **as unsigned** (though RISC-V does not have these).

📌 **Example: Signed vs. Unsigned Addition**

```assembly
li a0, -1       # Two’s complement representation: 0xFFFFFFFF
li a1, 1
add a2, a0, a1  # Signed: (-1 + 1) → a2 = 0
```

🚨 **Unsigned Interpretation of the Same Data**

```assembly
li a0, 0xFFFFFFFF   # Max unsigned 32-bit value (2^32 - 1)
li a1, 1
add a2, a0, a1      # Unsigned: (4294967295 + 1) → a2 = 0
```

✅ **Key Takeaway:**

- The same **binary value (`0xFFFFFFFF`) can represent `-1` (signed) or `4294967295` (unsigned)**.
- **RISC-V arithmetic (`add`, `sub`) treats numbers as signed by default.**

---

### **🔹 Multiplication (`mul` vs. `mulhu`)**

Multiplication can **produce results larger than 32-bit registers**, so RISC-V provides **special instructions to handle overflow**.

|**Instruction**|**Interpretation**|**Stores High Bits In**|
|---|---|---|
|`mul`|Signed multiplication|Ignores high bits|
|`mulh`|Signed multiplication|Stores high bits in destination register|
|`mulhu`|**Unsigned multiplication**|Stores high bits in destination register|

📌 **Example: Signed vs. Unsigned Multiplication**

```assembly
li a0, -2
li a1, 2147483647
mul a2, a0, a1   # Signed result (negative)
mulhu a2, a0, a1 # Unsigned result (positive)
```

✅ **Key Takeaway:**

- Use **`mulh` for signed numbers** and **`mulhu` for unsigned numbers**.

---

### **🔹 Division (`div` vs. `divu`)**

RISC-V provides **separate instructions for signed and unsigned division**.

|**Instruction**|**Interpretation**|
|---|---|
|`div`|**Signed division**|
|`divu`|**Unsigned division**|

📌 **Example: Signed vs. Unsigned Division**

```assembly
li a0, -10
li a1, 3
div a2, a0, a1  # a2 = -10 / 3 → -3

li a0, 0xFFFFFFF6  # -10 in two’s complement
li a1, 3
divu a2, a0, a1  # Unsigned: (4294967286 / 3) → large positive value
```

✅ **Key Takeaway:**

- **`div` treats numbers as signed**, while **`divu` treats them as unsigned**.
- **Unsigned division may give incorrect results if applied to signed numbers.**

---

## **5️⃣ Signed vs. Unsigned Branching Instructions**

Some branch instructions **treat numbers as signed**, while others **treat them as unsigned**.

|**Instruction**|**Comparison Type**|**Used For**|
|---|---|---|
|`beq` / `bne`|**Equality check**|Signed or unsigned|
|`blt` / `bge`|**Signed comparison**|Signed values|
|`bltu` / `bgeu`|**Unsigned comparison**|Unsigned values|

📌 **Example: Signed vs. Unsigned Branching**

```assembly
li a0, -1
li a1, 1
blt a0, a1, signed_less_than  # -1 < 1 → Branch taken

li a0, 0xFFFFFFFF   # Unsigned 4294967295
li a1, 1
bltu a0, a1, unsigned_less_than  # NOT taken (4294967295 > 1)
```

✅ **Key Takeaway:**

- **Use `blt` and `bge` for signed numbers**.
- **Use `bltu` and `bgeu` for unsigned numbers** to avoid incorrect results.

## **6️⃣ Summary: How Signed and Unsigned Numbers Work**

|**Aspect**|**Signed (`int`)**|**Unsigned (`uint`)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Storage**|Two’s complement|Direct binary representation|
|**Range (32-bit)**|`-2^31` to `2^31-1`|`0` to `2^32-1`|
|**Addition/Subtraction**|Wraps around if overflowed|Wraps to `0` if overflowed|
|**Multiplication**|`mul`, `mulh`|`mulhu`|
|**Division**|`div`|`divu`|
|**Comparison**|`blt`, `bge`|`bltu`, `bgeu`|

📌 **Final Takeaways:**

- **Signed numbers use two’s complement, while unsigned numbers use direct binary.**
- **Use signed instructions (`div`, `mulh`, `blt`) for signed values and unsigned instructions (`divu`, `mulhu`, `bltu`) for unsigned values.**
- **Branching requires special handling—use `bltu` and `bgeu` for unsigned comparisons.**
