# **Reinforcement: What Happens When Register Overflows in Arithmetic in RISC-V?**

Registers in RISC-V are **fixed-size** (32-bit in RV32, 64-bit in RV64). If a calculation **exceeds the register size**, an **overflow occurs**, potentially leading to incorrect results. Let’s explore how **RISC-V handles arithmetic overflow**.

---

## **1️⃣ What Is Overflow in Registers?**

Overflow occurs when **the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to fit in the destination register**.

📌 **Example: Overflow in a 32-bit Register (RV32I)**

```assembly
li a0, 2147483647  # Max 32-bit signed integer (2^31 - 1)
addi a0, a0, 1     # Add 1 (causes overflow)
```

✅ Expected: `2147483647 + 1 = 2147483648`  
🚨 **Actual Result (Overflowed Value)**: `-2147483648` (wraps around due to overflow)

✅ **Key Takeaway:**

- **Registers have a fixed size**, so values exceeding the range **wrap around (modulo arithmetic)**.

---

## **2️⃣ How Does RISC-V Handle Overflow?**

Unlike some architectures, **RISC-V does NOT generate an exception on overflow** for normal arithmetic (`add`, `sub`, `mul`).

- **Signed operations** wrap around following **two’s complement arithmetic**.
- **Unsigned operations** wrap around but do not interpret the sign bit.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- RISC-V **allows overflow silently** instead of triggering an error.
- Programmers must **manually check for overflow using branch instructions (`bgeu`, `bltu`)**.

---

## **3️⃣ Overflow in Signed vs. Unsigned Arithmetic**

|**Operation**|**Max Value Before Overflow (RV32I)**|**Overflowed Result**|
|---|---|---|
|**Signed Addition (`add`)**|`2^31 - 1` → `2147483647`|`-2147483648`|
|**Signed Subtraction (`sub`)**|`-2^31` → `-2147483648`|`2147483647`|
|**Unsigned Addition (`addu`)**|`2^32 - 1` → `4294967295`|`0`|
|**Unsigned Subtraction (`subu`)**|`0` → `0`|`4294967295`|

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- **Signed integers wrap around (two’s complement behavior)**.
- **Unsigned integers wrap around to `0` if they overflow**.

## **4️⃣ How to Detect Overflow in RISC-V**

Since RISC-V **does not raise an overflow exception**, programmers must **check manually**.

### **🔹 Detecting Signed Overflow (`add`, `sub`)**

Use **`blt` or `bge`** to check if overflow occurred.

```assembly
li a0, 2147483647  # Load max signed 32-bit value
li a1, 1
add a2, a0, a1     # a2 = a0 + a1

blt a2, a0, overflow_detected  # If a2 < a0, overflow occurred
```

✅ **Why This Works:**

- **If `a2` is smaller than `a0` after addition, overflow has occurred**.

---

### **🔹 Detecting Unsigned Overflow (`addu`, `subu`)**

Use **`bltu` (branch if less than unsigned)**:

```assembly
li a0, 0xFFFFFFFF  # Max unsigned 32-bit value
li a1, 1
add a2, a0, a1     # a2 = a0 + a1

bltu a2, a0, overflow_detected  # If a2 < a0, overflow occurred
```

✅ **Why This Works:**

- **For unsigned numbers, overflow makes the result smaller than the original number**.

---

## **5️⃣ Overflow in Multiplication and Division**

### **🔹 Multiplication Overflow (`mul`)**

Multiplication overflow **cannot be detected using `blt` or `bge`** because **products larger than 32 bits are stored in `hi` (RV32I only)**.

📌 **Example: Multiplication Overflow Handling**

```assembly
li a0, 0x7FFFFFFF  # Max signed 32-bit value (2^31 - 1)
li a1, 2
mul a2, a0, a1     # a2 = a0 * a1

bgez a2, no_overflow   # If a2 is negative, overflow occurred
```

✅ **Why This Works:**

- If `a2` becomes **negative after multiplication**, overflow has occurred.

### **🔹 Division Overflow (`div`)**

🚨 **Dangerous Case:**

```assembly
li a0, -2147483648  # Min signed 32-bit value (-2^31)
li a1, -1
div a2, a0, a1      # a2 = a0 / a1
```

✅ **Expected:** `(-2147483648) ÷ (-1) = 2147483648`  
🚨 **Actual Result (Overflowed Value)**: `-2147483648` (Wraps due to two’s complement)

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- **Dividing `-2^31` by `-1` causes an overflow.**
- **RISC-V does NOT trigger an exception, so programmers must check manually.**

---

## **6️⃣ Optimizing Performance While Avoiding Overflow**

|**Strategy**|**Why It Helps?**|
|---|---|
|**Use `blt` and `bltu` to detect overflow**|Prevents invalid calculations|
|**Use unsigned arithmetic for large numbers**|Avoids two’s complement wraparound|
|**Use `mulh` to store higher bits of multiplication results**|Prevents silent truncation|

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

- **Always check for overflow manually using branch instructions (`blt`, `bltu`).**
- **For multiplication, store the upper bits separately to prevent truncation (`mulh`).**
- **For division, check if the divisor is `-1` before performing `div`.**

---

## **7️⃣ Summary: How RISC-V Handles Overflow**

|**Operation**|**What Happens on Overflow?**|**How to Detect?**|
|---|---|---|
|**Signed Addition (`add`)**|Wraps to negative (`2^31 - 1` → `-2^31`)|`blt rd, rs1, overflow_label`|
|**Unsigned Addition (`addu`)**|Wraps to `0` (`2^32 - 1` → `0`)|`bltu rd, rs1, overflow_label`|
|**Multiplication (`mul`)**|Truncates result|Use `mulh` for upper bits|
|**Division (`div`)**|`-2^31 / -1` overflows|Check divisor before division|

📌 **Final Takeaways:**

- **RISC-V does NOT generate exceptions for overflow**.
- **Arithmetic wraps around using two’s complement (signed) or modulo (`mod 2^32`) (unsigned)**.
- **Overflow detection requires manual checking (`blt`, `bltu`)**.
