Let's walk through this method step by step from the very beginning to make sure it works as intended.

---

### Step 1: Folder and File Setup

Ensure you have the following files in the same directory:

1. **`main.c`**: This file should contain your `main()` function.
2. **`circle.c`**: This file should contain the implementation of `calculate_circle`.
3. **`circle.h`**: This file should declare `calculate_circle` as a function prototype.
4. **`Makefile`**: The `Makefile` we are creating here.
5. Any other optional files (like `triangle.c`).

---

### Step 2: File Content

#### **File: `main.c`**

This is the entry point of your program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "circle.h" // Include the circle header file

int main() {
    double radius;

    printf("\nEnter the radius of a circle: ");
    scanf("%lf", &radius);

    // Call calculate_circle only if it's implemented in circle.c
    calculate_circle(radius);

    return 0;
}
```

---

#### **File: `circle.c`**

This file contains the implementation of the `calculate_circle` function:

```c
#include "circle.h"
#include <stdio.h>

void calculate_circle(double radius) {
    const double PI = 3.14159;
    double circumference = 2 * PI * radius;
    double area = PI * radius * radius;

    printf("\nCircumference: %.2f", circumference);
    printf("\nArea: %.2f", area);
}
```

---

#### **File: `circle.h`**

This header file declares the `calculate_circle` function:

```c
#ifndef CIRCLE_H
#define CIRCLE_H

void calculate_circle(double radius);

#endif
```

---

### Step 3: Create the Makefile

Save the following content in a file named **`Makefile`** (case-sensitive, no extension):

```Makefile
# Compiler and flags
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra -std=c17 -g

# Define the files to include
SRCS = main.c        # Always include main.c
# Uncomment the files you want to compile:
SRCS += circle.c
# SRCS += triangle.c

# Build the executable
all: main

main: $(SRCS)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o main $(SRCS)

# Clean up the compiled files
clean:
	rm -f main
```

---

### Step 4: Compile the Program

1. Open the terminal in **Visual Studio Code** or your preferred terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing your files.

#### Compile:

Run the `make` command:

```bash
make
```

This will:

- Include `main.c` and `circle.c` in the compilation.
- Generate an executable named `main`.

#### Run the Program:

After compilation, run the program with:

```bash
./main
```

---

### Step 5: Clean Up

To remove the compiled `main` executable:

```bash
make clean
```

---

### **How to Enable/Disable Specific Files**

1. Open the `Makefile`.
2. To **include `circle.c`**, ensure the line is uncommented:
    
    ```Makefile
    SRCS += circle.c
    ```
    
3. To **exclude `circle.c`**, comment out the line:
    
    ```Makefile
    # SRCS += circle.c
    ```
    
4. Re-run `make` after modifying the `Makefile`.

---

### Common Troubleshooting

1. **Error: File Not Found**
    
    - Ensure all files (`main.c`, `circle.c`, `circle.h`, `Makefile`) are in the same directory.
2. **Error: Undefined Reference**
    
    - Ensure `circle.c` is included in `SRCS` in the `Makefile`.
    - Verify that `circle.h` is correctly included in `main.c`.
3. **Error: Makefile Not Found**
    
    - Ensure the file is named exactly `Makefile` (case-sensitive, no `.txt`).
