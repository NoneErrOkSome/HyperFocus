### **Linked List in C (Simplest Explanation)**

A **linked list** is a way to store data in memory where **each element (node) is linked to the next one**. Unlike arrays, linked lists **do not** store elements in consecutive memory locations.

---

### **🔹 Basic Structure**

Each element in a linked list is called a **node**, and every node has two parts:

1. **Data** → Stores the actual value.
2. **Pointer (Next)** → Stores the address of the next node.

A **linked list starts with a head pointer**, which points to the **first node**.

### **🔹 Visual Representation**

```
[Data | Next] → [Data | Next] → [Data | NULL]
```

The last node points to **NULL**, indicating the end.

### **🔹 Why Use a Linked List Instead of an Array?**

✅ **Dynamic Size** → No need to define the size beforehand (unlike arrays).  
✅ **Efficient Insert/Delete** → Adding/removing nodes doesn’t require shifting elements.  
❌ **Slower Access** → Cannot directly access elements like an array (must traverse).

### **🔹 Operations on a Linked List**

1️⃣ **Create a Node**  
2️⃣ **Insert a Node** (at beginning, middle, or end)  
3️⃣ **Delete a Node** (specific value or position)  
4️⃣ **Traverse** (print all elements)

---

### **🔹 Memory Representation**

Each node is dynamically allocated in **heap memory** using `malloc()`.
