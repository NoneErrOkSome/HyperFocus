Great approach! Let's start with the **most fundamental** data structures and algorithms, focusing on those with **minimal mathematics**, and gradually build up from there.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Absolute Basics (Pure Logic, No Math)**

These data structures and algorithms require **only logical thinking**, no complex calculations.

#### **Basic Data Structures**

- **Arrays** (Fixed-size, contiguous memory storage)
- **Linked Lists** (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- **Stacks** (LIFO - Last In, First Out)
- **Queues** (FIFO - First In, First Out)
    - **Priority Queue** (Variant, requires ordering)
    - **Deque (Double-ended queue)** (Insert/remove from both ends)

#### **Basic Algorithms**

- **Linear Search** (Checking elements one by one)
- **Bubble Sort** (Repeated swapping of adjacent elements)
- **Selection Sort** (Repeatedly picking the smallest element)
- **Insertion Sort** (Inserting elements in sorted order)
- **Stack & Queue Operations** (Push, Pop, Enqueue, Dequeue)
- **Basic Recursion** (Calling a function inside itself)

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Slightly Advanced (Still Minimal Math)**

These require **basic counting, comparisons, and memory handling**.

#### **Intermediate Data Structures**

- **Hash Table / Hash Map** (Key-value lookup, requires hashing)
- **Doubly Linked List** (Bidirectional traversal)
- **Circular Linked List** (Useful for scheduling)
- **Tree (Basic Concepts)** (Parent-child relationships)
- **Graph (Basic)** (Nodes and edges representation)

#### **Intermediate Algorithms**

- **Binary Search** (Efficient searching in sorted arrays)
- **Merge Sort** (Divide and conquer sorting)
- **Quick Sort** (Partitioning-based sorting)
- **Basic Tree Traversal** (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder)
- **Graph Traversal (DFS, BFS)** (Exploring connected nodes)

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ More Structured Thinking (Uses Some Math)**

These involve **mathematical properties, logical deductions, and optimizations**.

#### **Data Structures**

- **Heap (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)** (Efficient priority management)
- **Trie (Prefix Tree)** (Used in text processing)
- **Graph Representations** (Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List)
- **Union-Find / Disjoint Set** (Used for network connectivity)

#### **Algorithms**

- **Heap Sort** (Sorting using heaps)
- **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm** (Shortest path in weighted graphs)
- **Topological Sorting** (Sorting nodes with dependencies)
- **Greedy Algorithms** (Locally optimal choices for global solution)
- **Dynamic Programming (Basic)** (Breaking problems into subproblems)

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Problem-Solving (More Math)**

These require a **strong mathematical foundation**.

#### **Data Structures**

- **Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree, BIT)** (Efficient prefix sum)
- **Segment Tree** (Efficient range queries)
- **Suffix Array & Suffix Tree** (Used in string processing)
- **Skip List** (Linked list with fast lookups)

#### **Algorithms**

- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm** (Graph shortest paths)
- **Kruskal‚Äôs & Prim‚Äôs Algorithm** (Minimum spanning tree)
- **Dynamic Programming (Advanced)** (Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence)
- **Bit Manipulation Techniques** (Using binary operations)
- **Approximation Algorithms** (Used for NP-hard problems)

### **Building Plan from Scratch to Advanced**

‚úÖ **Start with Level 1 (Basic Structures & Sorting)**  
‚úÖ **Move to Level 2 (Efficient Searching & Recursion)**  
‚úÖ **Progress to Level 3 (Graphs, Trees, Heaps, Greedy Strategies)**  
‚úÖ **Reach Level 4 (Optimization, Dynamic Programming, NP-Hard Problems)**
