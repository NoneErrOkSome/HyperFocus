To print the address of a variable or a pointer in C, use the `%p` format specifier with `printf()`.

### **Example: Printing Addresses**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    int *p;  // Declaring a pointer to an integer
    p = &a;  // Assigning the address of 'a' to the pointer 'p'

    // Printing the address of 'a'
    printf("Address of a: %p\n", (void *)&a);

    // Printing the address stored in pointer 'p' (should be the same as &a)
    printf("Address stored in p: %p\n", (void *)p);

    // Printing the address of the pointer itself
    printf("Address of p: %p\n", (void *)&p);

    return 0;
}
```

### **Output (Example)**

```
Address of a: 0x7ffcb6c4a8dc
Address stored in p: 0x7ffcb6c4a8dc
Address of p: 0x7ffcb6c4a8e0
```

### **Explanation**

- `&a` gives the memory address of the variable `a`.
- `p` stores the address of `a`, so printing `p` gives the same address as `&a`.
- `&p` gives the address where the pointer `p` itself is stored.

⚠️ **Note:** Always cast pointer addresses to `(void *)` when printing with `%p` for portability and correctness.


**Yes**, `&` means **address-of** (it gives the memory address of a variable, not its value).
