**Question:**

```rust
fn main() {
    // Use as many approaches as you can to make it work
    let x = String::from("hello, world");
    let y = x;
    println!("{},{}",x,y);
}
```

You're asked to modify this code such that it works. The original version of the code has an error because in Rust, values like `String` have the 'move' behavior by default. Once the `String` object is assigned to `y`, it's no longer available in `x`, which causes an error when we try to use `x` afterwards.

**Answer:**

There are multiple approaches you could take to fix this:

1. Clone the String so both `x` and `y` have their own copy:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = String::from("hello, world");
    let y = x.clone();
    println!("{},{}",x,y);
}
```

2. Use references to `String`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = String::from("hello, world");
    let y = &x;
    println!("{},{}",x,y);
}
```

3. Use copy-on-write `String` (requires `std::borrow::Cow`):

```rust
use std::borrow::Cow;

fn main() {
    let x: Cow<str> = Cow::Borrowed("hello, world");
    let y = x.clone();
    println!("{},{}",x,y);
}
```

In all three examples, `x` is still valid when we try to print it. This is because in the first example we're creating a new `String` that has the same contents as `x`, in the second example we're just creating a reference to `x`, and in the third example we're creating a copy-on-write `String`, which won't actually be copied unless we try to modify it.

**Question:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello, world");
    let s2 = take_ownership(s1);

    println!("{}", s2);
}

fn take_ownership(s: String) {
    println!("{}", s);
}
```

The error is due to the function `take_ownership(s: String)` which takes the ownership of the string `s` but does not return it, therefore `s` becomes invalid after the function call and cannot be used anymore. 

In the main function, `s2` is trying to assign the return value of `take_ownership(s1)`. However, `take_ownership(s1)` currently doesn't return anything (it returns `()` by default), which leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual return types.

**Answer:**

To make the code work, we need to modify `take_ownership(s: String)` to return the `String` after it prints:

```rust
fn take_ownership(s: String) -> String {
    println!("{}", s);
    s // return the String back to the caller
}
```

In this way, after `take_ownership(s1)` is called, `s1` will be moved into `take_ownership` function and then be moved back to `s2`. Thus, `s2` will be the valid owner of the string, and you can print `s2` in the main function.

Question:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = give_ownership();
    println!("{}", s);
}

// Only modify the code below!
fn give_ownership() -> String {
    let s = String::from("hello, world");
    // Convert String to Vec
    let _s = s.into_bytes();
    s
}
```
The code has an issue where the string `s` is converted to bytes and moved to `_s`, causing `s` to no longer be available for use (since String in Rust is non-cloneable by default).

The question asks to modify the `give_ownership` function so that it still returns a `String`, while also converting the string to bytes.

Answer:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = give_ownership();
    println!("{}", s);
}

fn give_ownership() -> String {
    let s = String::from("hello, world");
    let _s = s.clone().into_bytes();
    s
}
```

Here, we clone the string `s` before converting it to bytes. This allows us to create a byte vector from the string without taking ownership of `s`, thus we can still return `s` at the end of the function.

---

`into_bytes()` and `clone()` are methods provided by the Rust standard library for operations on String objects.

1. `into_bytes()`: This method is defined for a `String` in Rust. It consumes the `String` and returns a vector of bytes (`Vec<u8>`), effectively giving a byte-level representation of the string. This operation is useful when you want to inspect the bytes that make up a String, or when you want to manipulate a String at the byte level.

2. `clone()`: This method is defined by the `Clone` trait in Rust, which is implemented by many types in the standard library, including `String`. The `clone()` method creates a copy of the value it is called on. It's important to note that what "copy" means can vary depending on the type. For types that own heap-allocated data like `String`, `clone()` typically creates a new copy of the data on the heap, so that the original and cloned values do not share the same data. This is necessary because many types in Rust have ownership semantics that prevent multiple variables from owning the same data.

In summary, `clone()` is used when you want to duplicate a value and `into_bytes()` is used when you want to convert a string into a byte vector.

---
Sure, here are detailed examples of `clone()` and `into_bytes()`:

1. `clone()`: 

In Rust, when you assign a variable to another, the original variable is moved, which means it is no longer valid. If you still want to use the original variable after the assignment, you have to `clone()` it. 

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1.clone(); // create a copy of s1

    println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);
}
```

In the above code, `s1` is cloned to `s2`. Now `s1` and `s2` are two separate variables with the same value. If you modify `s1`, `s2` will not be affected and vice versa because they do not share the same memory.

2. `into_bytes()`: 

`into_bytes()` is a method that consumes the `String` and returns a `Vec<u8>`, which is a byte representation of the string. Each character in the string is converted to its corresponding ASCII value and stored in the vector. 

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let bytes = s.into_bytes(); 

    println!("{:?}", bytes); // prints: [104, 101, 108, 108, 111]
}
```

In the above code, the string "hello" is converted into a vector of bytes. The ASCII values for 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' are 104, 101, 108, 108, and 111 respectively. Note that after calling `into_bytes()`, `s` is no longer valid. If you try to use `s` after this point, you'll get a compile error.

Please remember that `into_bytes()` can only be used with strings that contain ASCII characters. If your string contains non-ASCII characters, the values in the vector will not correspond to the character codes you might expect, because Rust strings are UTF-8 encoded by default.

Question:
```
// Fix the error without removing code line
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello, world");

    print_str(s);

    println!("{}", s);
}

fn print_str(s: String)  {
    println!("{}",s)
}
```

Answer:

The Rust language follows a strict ownership model which is related to memory management. When a variable's ownership is moved, the original variable can no longer be used. This is what happens in your code. In the `main()` function, when you pass `s` to the `print_str(s)` function, the ownership of `s` is moved to the function. This means `s` is no longer valid in the `main()` function, which is why you get a compile error when you try to use `s` in the `println!()` statement.

The fix here involves not transferring ownership when we pass `s` to the `print_str()` function. We can achieve this by passing a reference to `s` instead. In Rust, references allow you to refer to some value without taking ownership of it.

Here's the corrected code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello, world");

    print_str(&s);

    println!("{}", s);
}

fn print_str(s: &String)  {
    println!("{}",s)
}
```
In this code, `&s` creates a reference to `s`. `print_str()` takes a reference to a string (`&String`) as an argument. It doesn't take ownership of the string, so `s` is still valid after the call to `print_str()`. This is why we can use `s` in the `println!()` statement later. This concept in Rust is called "borrowing". When function parameters are references, the function does not own the parameters; it is merely borrowing them for a while. 

To summarise, the error was due to the Rust ownership rules, which prevent a value from being used after its ownership has been moved. The solution is to use references, which allows you to use a value without taking ownership of it. This is called "borrowing" in Rust.

Question:
```rust
// Don't use clone ,use copy instead
fn main() {
    let x = (1, 2, (), "hello".to_string());
    let y = x.clone();
    println!("{:?}, {:?}", x, y);
}
```

Answer:

In Rust, there is a distinction between deep and shallow copying. Deep copying means that a completely new and independent object is created in the memory, while shallow copying creates a new object that shares the same memory with the original object.

The `Copy` trait in Rust signifies that an object is suitable for bitwise copy, i.e., shallow copy. The object's `clone()` method won't be called when the object is copied. Types like integers, boolean values, floating point numbers, character (`char`), tuples, and arrays are `Copy` if they only contain types which are `Copy`. 

The `Clone` trait in Rust is used when we want to explicitly create a deep copy of an object. It provides a method `clone()`, which returns a copy of the object it is called on.

The `Copy` trait cannot be used in this particular case, because the `String` type does not implement the `Copy` trait. The `String` type is more complex and needs to allocate memory, so a bitwise copy could lead to problems like double free errors.

The `Clone` trait, on the other hand, can be used for `String`. When you call `clone()` on a `String`, it creates a new `String` with a separate copy of the data.

So, unfortunately, in your case you cannot replace `clone()` with a simple assignment (which would invoke the `Copy` trait) because your tuple contains a `String`, and `String` is not `Copy`. The reason for this is that a `String` owns its content (i.e., has allocated memory for it), and copying the `String` would imply copying the content, which is more complex than a simple bitwise copy.

If you want to make a copy of the tuple `x` without using `clone()`, you will have to create a new tuple and copy each field manually, but this only works because all the other types in the tuple (`i32`, `()`) implement `Copy`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = (1, 2, (), "hello".to_string());
    let y = (x.0, x.1, x.2, x.3.clone());
    println!("{:?}, {:?}", x, y);
}
```

In this code, `x.0`, `x.1`, and `x.2` are copied because `i32` and `()` are `Copy`, and `x.3.clone()` is used to make a new `String` that is a copy of `x.3`.

#### [Mutability](https://practice.rs/ownership/ownership.html#mutability)

Mutability can be changed when ownership is transferred.

6. ðŸŒŸ

The question is:

```rust
// Don't use clone ,use copy instead
fn main() {
    let x = (1, 2, (), "hello".to_string());
    let y = &x;
    println!("{:?}, {:?}", x, y);
}
```

In this code snippet, you're asked to use a `copy` method instead of `clone` to make a duplicate of a tuple. However, in Rust, not all types are `Copy`. In this case, the tuple contains an owned `String`, which is not `Copy`, so you can't use the `copy` trait on `x`.

Instead of making a copy of the tuple, the provided solution creates a reference to the tuple with `let y = &x;`. This way, `y` becomes a reference pointing to the location of `x` without owning the data. This enables you to use `x` in the `println!` statement after `y` has been assigned, because `x` hasn't been moved into `y`, just referenced by it.

The solution code is:

```rust
// Don't use clone ,use copy instead
fn main() {
    let x = (1, 2, (), "hello".to_string());
    let y = &x;
    println!("{:?}, {:?}", x, y);
}
```

When this program runs, it will print the contents of `x` and `y`. Since `y` is a reference to `x`, it will print the same data as `x`.

Please note that `y` is an immutable reference to `x`, meaning that you can't mutate `x` through `y`. Additionally, as long as `y` is in scope and holds a reference to `x`, `x` can't be mutated at all to maintain Rust's safety guarantees.

7. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
The question is:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = Box::new(5);
    
    let ...      // Implement this line, dont change other lines!
    
    *y = 4;
    
    assert_eq!(*x, 5);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

This code has an issue where it is trying to change the value that `x` points to via `y`, and then assert that `x` is still equal to the original value. This will fail as currently `y` is supposed to point to the same memory location as `x` (if we try to implement the line with `let y = x;` or `let y = &mut x;`), and changing `y` will change `x`. 

The solution here is to create `y` not as a pointer to `x`, but as a new box pointing to a new integer in the heap. Then changing `y` will not affect `x`. Here's how you can do that:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = Box::new(5);
    
    let y = Box::new(3); // Here is the implementation.
    
    *y = 4;
    
    assert_eq!(*x, 5);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

In this solution, `y` points to a different place in memory than `x` so changing `y` does not affect `x`. Thus the assertion `assert_eq!(*x, 5);` succeeds as the value `x` points to has not changed, and the code prints "Success!".

### [Partial move](https://practice.rs/ownership/ownership.html#partial-move)

Within the destructuring of a single variable, both by-move and by-reference pattern bindings can be used at the same time. Doing this will result in a partial move of the variable, which means that parts of the variable will be moved while other parts stay. In such a case, the parent variable cannot be used afterwards as a whole, however the parts that are only referenced (and not moved) can still be used.

---

In Rust, a partial move is a move operation that only moves part of the data from one location to another. This can be useful when you only need a part of the data from an object, or when you want to avoid copying a large amount of data.

To perform a partial move, you can use the `move` keyword followed by the name of the variable that you want to move. For example, the following code moves the first three elements of the vector `v` into the vector `w`:

```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let mut w = vec![];

w.move_from(&v[..3]);

assert_eq!(w, vec![1, 2, 3]);
```

Note that the original vector `v` is still valid after the move, but it is now only three elements long.

Partial moves can also be used to move data into a function. For example, the following function takes a vector of integers and returns a new vector that contains the first three elements of the original vector:

```rust
fn move_first_three(v: &mut Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    let mut w = vec![];
    w.move_from(&v[..3]);
    w
}
```

The function `move_first_three` can be used as follows:

```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let w = move_first_three(&mut v);

assert_eq!(w, vec![1, 2, 3]);
assert_eq!(v, vec![4, 5]);
```

Partial moves can be a powerful tool for optimizing your Rust code. By carefully choosing which data to move, you can avoid unnecessary copying and improve the performance of your program.

Question:
```rust
fn main() {
   let t = (String::from("hello"), String::from("world"));

   let _s = t.0;

   // Modify this line only, don't use `_s`
   println!("{:?}", t);
}
```

This code currently doesn't work because of the concept of ownership in Rust. In Rust, each value has a variable that's called its owner, and there can only be one owner at a time. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

In this code, the variable `_s` becomes the new owner of the string at position 0 of the tuple `t`, which is `"hello"`. This is because the assignment operation in Rust denotes a move. 

When `println!("{:?}", t)` is called, it tries to access the tuple `t`, which includes the first element of the tuple. However, because that value has been moved to `_s`, it is no longer available for use, causing a compile error.

To make it work while only modifying the `println!` line and not using `_s`, you could print the second element of the tuple:

```rust
fn main() {
   let t = (String::from("hello"), String::from("world"));

   let _s = t.0;

   // Modified line to print second element of tuple
   println!("{:?}", t.1);
}
```

This modified code will compile and run successfully, printing `world` to the console. Note that the first element of the tuple, `"hello"`, is still moved to `_s` and can't be used within `t` anymore, but it doesn't cause a problem because we no longer try to access `t.0`.

**Question:**

```rust
fn main() {
   let t = (String::from("hello"), String::from("world"));

    // Fill the blanks
    let (__, __) = __;

    println!("{:?}, {:?}, {:?}", s1, s2, t); // -> "hello", "world", ("hello", "world")
}
```
This code is meant to create a tuple `t` with two `String`s, destructure `t` to get references to its elements, and then print those elements individually as well as the whole tuple.

The code is incomplete, the task is to fill in the blanks to make the code compile and work as intended.

**Answer:**

```rust
fn main() {
   let t = (String::from("hello"), String::from("world"));

    // Destructure the tuple `t` to get references to its elements
    let (s1, s2) = &t;

    println!("{:?}, {:?}, {:?}", s1, s2, t); // -> "hello", "world", ("hello", "world")
}
```

In this code, we're creating a tuple `t` that contains two `String`s. Then we're destructuring `t` with `let (s1, s2) = &t;`. The `&t` creates a reference to `t`, which means `s1` and `s2` are now both references (`&String`) to the elements of `t`. This allows us to use `t`, `s1`, and `s2` afterwards, because `s1` and `s2` do not take ownership of `t`'s elements.

Finally, we use `println!` to print `s1`, `s2`, and `t`. As `s1` and `s2` are references to `t`'s elements, and `println!` takes a reference as argument, we can use them directly. And because we haven't transferred the ownership of `t`, we're still able to use `t` in the `println!` call. This will print the strings "hello", "world", and the tuple `("hello", "world")`.
