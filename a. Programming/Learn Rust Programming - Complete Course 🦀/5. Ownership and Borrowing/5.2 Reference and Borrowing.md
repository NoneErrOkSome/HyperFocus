**Question:**

```rust
fn main() {
   let x = 5;
   // Fill the blank
   let p = __;

   println!("the memory address of x is {:p}", p); // One possible output: 0x16fa3ac84
}
```
The aim of this code is to obtain the memory address of the variable `x` and print it. The variable `p` is supposed to hold a reference to the memory location of `x`, but it's currently left as a placeholder (`__`).

**Answer:**

```rust
fn main() {
   let x = 5;
   // Use the `&` operator to get a reference to `x`
   let p = &x;

   println!("the memory address of x is {:p}", p); // One possible output: 0x16fa3ac84
}
```

In this code, we are using the `&` operator to get a reference to `x`, which means `p` will now hold the memory address where `x` is stored. We then use the `println!` macro with the `:p` format specifier to print the memory address. The `:p` format specifier is used for pointers, and will print the memory address that `p` is pointing to.

Remember that the actual output will vary each time you run the program, as the operating system can choose to store `x` at a different memory address each time.

**Question:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = &x;

    // Modify this line only
    assert_eq!(5, y);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

The code creates a variable `x` and assigns the value `5` to it. Then it creates a reference to `x` called `y`. The `assert_eq!` macro is used to assert that two values are equal to each other. If they are not equal, the program will panic and print an error message. The issue here is that `y` is a reference, not an integer. Therefore, it cannot be directly compared to `5`.

**Answer:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = &x;

    // Dereference `y` before comparing
    assert_eq!(5, *y);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

To make the `assert_eq!` macro work as expected, we need to dereference `y` before comparing. This is done by using the `*` operator. This way, we are comparing the value `5` to the value that `y` is referencing (also `5`), rather than comparing `5` to a memory address. 

The `*` operator is used to dereference a reference, which means to get the value that the reference is pointing to. The `assert_eq!` macro then successfully compares these two equal values and the program does not panic, allowing the "Success!" message to be printed.

**Question:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello, ");

    borrow_object(s);

    println!("Success!");
}

fn borrow_object(s: &String) {}
```

The problem with the above code is that the `borrow_object` function is expecting a reference to a `String` as its argument, but in the main function, the `String` `s` is being passed directly to `borrow_object`. This is causing an error because Rust expects the types of arguments to match exactly - if a function expects a reference, then a reference needs to be passed.

**Answer:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello, ");

    borrow_object(&s);

    println!("Success!");
}

fn borrow_object(s: &String) {}
```

To fix this error, you simply need to pass a reference to `s` to the `borrow_object` function. This is done by prefixing `s` with `&` when calling `borrow_object`. The `&` symbol is used to create a reference to a value in Rust.

When you use the `&` symbol before the `s` variable, you are creating a reference to the `String` `s` instead of giving ownership of `s` to `borrow_object`. This allows you to use `s` again after the `borrow_object` call, and this also means you're conforming to the function signature of `borrow_object`, which expects a reference to a `String`.

This concept of borrowing is one of the key aspects of Rust's system of ownership. It allows you to reference a value without taking ownership of it, which can help prevent common programming errors like null pointer dereferencing and dangling pointers.

4. ðŸŒŸ
**Question:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello, ");

    push_str(s);

    println!("Success!");
}

fn push_str(s: &mut String) {
    s.push_str("world")
}
```

The problem with this code is that the `push_str` function is expecting a mutable reference to a `String` as its argument, but the main function is passing a `String` directly to `push_str`. This will result in an error because Rust expects the types of arguments to match exactly - if a function expects a mutable reference, then a mutable reference needs to be passed.

**Answer:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello, ");

    push_str(&mut s);

    println!("Success!");
}

fn push_str(s: &mut String) {
    s.push_str("world")
}
```

To fix this error, you simply need to pass a mutable reference to `s` to the `push_str` function. This is done by prefixing `s` with `&mut` when calling `push_str`. The `&mut` symbol is used to create a mutable reference to a value in Rust.

The `&mut` before the `s` variable creates a mutable reference to `s` instead of moving `s` into `push_str`. This allows `push_str` to modify `s` without taking ownership, and it allows you to use `s` again after the call to `push_str`.

Mutable references in Rust are a way of borrowing a value with the intent to modify it. Rust enforces a rule that you can have either many immutable references or one mutable reference at a time, which helps to prevent data races at compile time.

5. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
**Question:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello, ");

    // Fill the blank to make it work
    let p = __;
    
    p.push_str("world");

    println!("Success!");
}
```

This Rust code snippet is asking you to fill in the blank with a statement that makes the code compile and run successfully. The `push_str` method requires a mutable reference to a string, and you are asked to assign such a reference to the variable `p`.

**Answer:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello, ");

    // Fill the blank to make it work
    let p = &mut s;
    
    p.push_str("world");

    println!("Success!");
}
```

In the above code, `p` is assigned as a mutable reference to `s` with `let p = &mut s;`. Here `&mut s` creates a mutable reference to `s`. Now `p` is a mutable reference pointing to the same memory location where `s` is stored. Then, we use the `push_str` method to append "world" to the string that `p` points to (which is `s`).

The `&mut` keyword in Rust is used to create a mutable reference. Mutable references allow you to change the data the reference points to. However, you can only have one mutable reference to a particular piece of data in a particular scope. This is one of the ways Rust ensures memory safety at compile-time.

Ref
`ref` can be used to take references to a value, similar to `&`.

6. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

**Question:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let c = 'ä¸­';

    let r1 = &c;
    // Fill the blankï¼Œdont change other code
    let __ r2 = c;

    assert_eq!(*r1, *r2);
    
    // Check the equality of the two address strings
    assert_eq!(get_addr(r1),get_addr(r2));

    println!("Success!");
}

// Get memory address string
fn get_addr(r: &char) -> String {
    format!("{:p}", r)
}
```
In this Rust code snippet, the objective is to fill in the blank such that the code compiles successfully. The given variable `c` is a char, `r1` is a reference to `c`, and you're asked to create another reference `r2` to `c` using the `ref` keyword instead of `&`. 

The program asserts that the chars pointed to by `r1` and `r2` are equal, and it also checks the memory addresses of `r1` and `r2` are the same. 

**Answer:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let c = 'ä¸­';

    let r1 = &c;
    // Fill the blankï¼Œdont change other code
    let ref r2 = c;

    assert_eq!(*r1, *r2);
    
    // Check the equality of the two address strings
    assert_eq!(get_addr(r1),get_addr(r2));

    println!("Success!");
}

// Get memory address string
fn get_addr(r: &char) -> String {
    format!("{:p}", r)
}
```

In the filled blank, `let ref r2 = c;` is used to create `r2` as a reference to `c`. `ref` is a keyword in Rust that indicates reference. When used in a pattern, it allows us to create references to values as they are deconstructed, which avoids making a copy of the value. 

Here, `ref r2` in the pattern on the left means `r2` should bind by reference to the matched value (which is `c`), and because there's no mutability specified, it's an immutable reference.

So `let ref r2 = c;` is equivalent to `let r2 = &c;`, both create an immutable reference `r2` to `c`. The references `r1` and `r2` have the same memory address because they refer to the same value `c`.

Borrowing Rule

In Rust, memory safety is managed through a system of ownership, with a set of rules that the compiler checks at compile time. It does not slow down your program and does not require garbage collection. The rules are:

1. **Ownership Rule**: Every value in Rust has a variable that's called its owner.
2. **Borrowing Rule**: One value can be borrowed at a time or any number of immutable references (`&T`) OR exactly one mutable reference (`&mut T`).
3. **Scope Rule**: The owner is valid from where it's introduced until the end of the current scope.

These rules are enforced at compile time and help prevent data races at runtime.

**Borrowing**: This allows for accessing a value without taking ownership over it. This is done by referencing, using `&`. References are immutable by default, but you can have mutable references using `&mut`.

Example:
```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let len = calculate_length(&s1);
println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```
Here, `&s1` allows the function to access `s1`'s value but doesn't take ownership. Hence, `s1` can be used after the function call.

A mutable reference can be created like:
```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");
change(&mut s);

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```
Note that you can only have one mutable reference to a particular piece of data in a particular scope. This prevents data races.

**Rust's borrowing rules**:
- Two or more pointers can read the data at the same time (Immutable references)
- Only one pointer can read/write the data (Mutable reference)
- Mutable and Immutable references cannot coexist.

If the program violates these rules, the compiler will throw an error.

Certainly, the rule "Mutable and Immutable references cannot coexist" is one of the core principles of Rust's borrowing system, designed to prevent data races at compile time. A data race can occur when these three behaviors happen simultaneously:

1. Two or more pointers access the same data.
2. At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.
3. There's no mechanism in place to synchronize access to the data.

In Rust, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references, but not both at the same time. This rule is enforced at compile time.

Let's see this in action:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");  // 1. We declare a mutable String variable s.

    let r1 = &s;  // 2. We create an immutable reference to s. We can create any number of these, and they can coexist.
    let r2 = &s;  // 3. We create another immutable reference to s. 

    println!("{}, {}", r1, r2); // 4. Here, we can use r1 and r2, because they are both immutable references. 

    let r3 = &mut s; // 5. This is where we get into trouble. We're trying to create a mutable reference to s while immutable references exist.
    
    println!("{}", r3); // 6. Even if we were allowed to create r3, we wouldn't be allowed to use it here, because r1 and r2 are still in scope and still hold references to s.
}
```

This code will not compile because we're trying to make a mutable reference to `s` while immutable references to `s` still exist. This would allow `r3` to modify `s` while `r1` and `r2` still have a read-only view of it, which could lead to inconsistencies and is therefore disallowed.

To make this work, we would need to ensure that the immutable references `r1` and `r2` go out of scope before we create the mutable reference `r3`. One way to do this would be to put the creation and use of `r1` and `r2` inside a block, so they go out of scope before `r3` is created. Here's how we can do that:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello"); // 1. We declare a mutable String variable s.

    { // 2. Start of new scope
        let r1 = &s; // 3. We create an immutable reference to s.
        let r2 = &s; // 4. We create another immutable reference to s. 
        println!("{}, {}", r1, r2); // 5. Here, we can use r1 and r2, because they are both immutable references. 
    } // 6. End of scope, r1 and r2 are no longer valid.

    let r3 = &mut s; // 7. Now that r1 and r2 are out of scope, we can create a mutable reference to s.
    
    println!("{}", r3); // 8. And now we can use r3.
}
```

In this revised code, `r1` and `r2` go out of scope before we create `r3`, so we're not violating the rule that mutable and immutable references cannot coexist.

7. ðŸŒŸ

**Question:**

```rust
// Remove something to make it work
// Don't remove a whole line !
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &mut s;
    let r2 = &mut s;

    println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

The above code does not compile because it breaks Rust's borrowing rules. Specifically, the code tries to create two mutable references to `s` in the same scope, which is not allowed. This is because Rust prevents data races at compile time, and having two mutable references to the same data in the same scope could lead to data races if one reference was used to modify the data while the other reference was being read.

**Answer:**

To fix this, you can limit the scope of the first mutable reference, `r1`, so that it doesn't overlap with the scope of the second mutable reference, `r2`. You can do this by placing `r1` within its own set of braces `{}`. Here's how:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    {
        let r1 = &mut s;
        println!("{}", r1);
    }
    let r2 = &mut s;

    println!("{}", r2);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

In this version of the code, `r1` goes out of scope before `r2` is created, so there are never two mutable references to `s` in the same scope. As a result, the code now compiles and runs successfully.

8. ðŸŒŸ Error: Borrow an immutable object as mutable

```rust
// Fix error by modifying this line 
fn main() { 

let s = String::from("hello, "); 

borrow_object(&mut s); 

println!("Success!"); 

}

fn borrow_object(s: &mut String) {}
```

Sure, here is the explanation.

In Rust, a mutable reference to an object allows the referenced object to be changed. This is in contrast to an immutable reference, which allows reading the object but not changing it. When you're calling a function that takes a mutable reference, you must also pass a mutable reference.

In the provided code, the function `borrow_object` is defined to take a mutable reference to a `String`. However, in the `main` function, you are trying to pass an immutable reference to the `String` `s`. The compiler will not allow this because it's possible that `borrow_object` could try to modify `s`, but `s` is not mutable.

So, to resolve this, you should declare `s` as mutable in the `main` function and then pass a mutable reference to `s` when you call `borrow_object`.

Here's the corrected code:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Fix error by modifying this line
    let mut s = String::from("hello, "); // Declare `s` as mutable

    borrow_object(&mut s); // Pass a mutable reference to `s`

    println!("Success!");
}

fn borrow_object(s: &mut String) {} // This function takes a mutable reference to a String
```

In this corrected code, `s` is declared as mutable with `let mut s = ...`. This allows `s` to be changed after it's initialized. Then, when calling `borrow_object`, a mutable reference to `s` is created with `&mut s` and passed to `borrow_object`.

Remember, if you declare a variable as mutable, you're making a promise to the Rust compiler that you might change that variable in the future. And if a function takes a mutable reference, it is a signal that the function may change the value of the argument. The Rust compiler uses these signals to enforce strict borrowing and lifetime rules that help prevent bugs related to mutable state.

---
9. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
In this code, there are two operations happening:

1. The `borrow_object` function is being called with an immutable reference to the `String` variable `s`. This operation is read-only and doesn't modify the `s` variable.

2. After the call to `borrow_object`, the `push_str` method is called on `s` to append the string `"world"` to `s`. Because `s` is declared as mutable (`let mut s`), this operation is allowed.

Let's break this down:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello, "); // Declare `s` as mutable

    borrow_object(&s); // Pass an immutable reference to `s` to `borrow_object`

    // After `borrow_object` is done, you can mutate `s` because `borrow_object` only borrowed `s` immutably, 
    // meaning it did not take ownership or modify `s`
    s.push_str("world");

    println!("Success!");
}

fn borrow_object(s: &String) {} // This function takes an immutable reference to a String
```

Remember, Rust's borrowing rules allow for multiple immutable references or exactly one mutable reference at a time for a particular piece of data. In this code:

- You're first creating an immutable borrow when calling `borrow_object`, which is fine because no other references are being used at the same time.
- Then, once the `borrow_object` call is over, the borrow ends, and you're allowed to create a new (mutable) reference when calling `push_str`.

The critical point is that these two borrows do not overlap. The Rust compiler checks all these borrowing and mutability rules at compile time and ensures that your program doesn't violate them, thereby preventing a large class of bugs.

### NLL

Absolutely, here are some examples that illustrate how Non-Lexical Lifetimes (NLL) work.

Let's consider a code snippet that gives an error in Rust 2015 (without NLL), but would compile successfully in Rust 2018 (with NLL).

```rust
// Rust 2015 - This code would fail
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;

    let y = &x;   // y borrows x
    // do something with y

    x = 6;  // Error! Can't mutate x because it's still borrowed by y
    // y is not used after this point
}

// Rust 2018 (with NLL) - This code would work
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;

    {
        let y = &x;   // y borrows x
        // do something with y
    }   // y goes out of scope here, so x is no longer borrowed

    x = 6;  // This is now allowed, because x is no longer borrowed by y
    // y is not used after this point
}
```

In the Rust 2015 example, the lifetime of the reference `y` is tied to its lexical scope, which lasts until the end of the `main` function. Because of this, `x` cannot be mutated after `y` has borrowed it, leading to a compile error.

In the Rust 2018 example, NLL allows the lifetime of the reference `y` to end immediately after its last usage, freeing up `x` to be mutated afterwards.

Here's another example:

```rust
// Rust 2015 - This code would fail
fn main() {
    let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let p = &v[0];   // p borrows v
    v.push(4);       // Error! Can't mutate v because it's still borrowed by p
    // p is not used after this point
}

// Rust 2018 (with NLL) - This code would work
fn main() {
    let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];

    {
        let p = &v[0];   // p borrows v
        // do something with p
    }   // p goes out of scope here, so v is no longer borrowed

    v.push(4);       // This is now allowed, because v is no longer borrowed by p
    // p is not used after this point
}
```

These examples illustrate how Non-Lexical Lifetimes can lead to more intuitive borrow checking and eliminate unnecessary borrow checker errors.

Question:
```rust
// Comment one line to make it work
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello, ");

    let r1 = &mut s;
    r1.push_str("world");
    let r2 = &mut s;
    r2.push_str("!");
    
    println!("{}",r1);
}
```
In the above Rust code, a string `s` is created and then two mutable references to `s` are created sequentially: `r1` and `r2`. `r1` is used to append the word "world" to `s` and `r2` is used to append the exclamation mark. The error in the code is because of Rust's borrowing rules which prevent having two or more mutable references to the same data in the same scope. This is done to prevent data races.

Answer:
```rust
// Comment one line to make it work
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello, ");

    let r1 = &mut s;
    r1.push_str("world");
    //let r2 = &mut s;
    //r2.push_str("!");
    
    println!("{}",r1);
}
```
In the modified code, the line creating the second mutable reference and the line using this reference to append an exclamation mark are commented out. With these lines removed, the code now only creates one mutable reference to `s` in the scope and hence it works without any errors.

To explain further, Rustâ€™s borrowing rules help to ensure thread safety and prevent data races. According to the rules:

1. Any number of immutable references (i.e., &T) to the data can exist in the same scope but they can't coexist with any mutable reference to the same data.
2. Only one mutable reference (i.e., &mut T) to the data can exist in the same scope.
   
So, by commenting out the second mutable reference creation and usage, the code is following these rules and thus works successfully.

11. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

Question:
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello, ");

    let r1 = &mut s;
    let r2 = &mut s;

    // Add one line below to make a compiler error: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time
    // You can't use r1 and r2 at the same time
}
```
In the code above, the string `s` is mutable and two mutable references to `s` are created: `r1` and `r2`. But there is no line of code that uses these mutable references. The question asks for a line of code to be added that causes a compiler error because `s` is borrowed as mutable more than once at a time.

Answer:
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello, ");

    let r1 = &mut s;
    let r2 = &mut s;

    // Add one line below to make a compiler error: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time
    // You can't use r1 and r2 at the same time
    r1.push_str("world");
}
```
In the modified code, a line has been added where the mutable reference `r1` is used to append the string "world" to `s`. This line of code leads to a compiler error: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time. This is because Rust's borrowing rules allow only one mutable reference to a particular piece of data in a particular scope. Here, `r1` and `r2` are in the same scope and both are mutable references to `s`, hence it violates Rust's borrowing rules.

To provide more context, these rules are in place to prevent data races at compile time. A data race can occur when two or more pointers access the same memory location at the same time, where at least one of them is writing, and the operations are not synchronized. By ensuring that a mutable reference to a piece of data is exclusive (no other references exist while it's in scope), Rust effectively prevents data races.
