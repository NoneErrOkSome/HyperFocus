### [Binding and mutability](https://practice.rs/variables.html#binding-and-mutability)

1. ðŸŒŸ A variable can be used only if it has been initialized.

Question:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32; // Uninitialized but used, ERROR !
    let y: i32; // Uninitialized but also unused, only a Warning !

    assert_eq!(x, 5);
    println!("Success!");
}
```

The above Rust code does not compile because the variable `x` is declared but not initialized before it is used in the `assert_eq!` macro, which is a violation of Rust's safety guarantees to prevent null or dangling references. The variable `y` is also declared but not initialized or used, resulting in a warning, but this will not stop the code from compiling.

In Rust, all variables must be initialized before they're used. This is a feature of the language designed to prevent null reference bugs, among other things.

Here's a simple correction to the code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 5; // Initialized before use
    let y: i32 = 0; // Initialized, but unused

    assert_eq!(x, 5);
    println!("Success!");
}
```

In this corrected version, we initialize `x` with the value `5` and `y` with `0` at the point of their declarations. This means when we reach the `assert_eq!` macro, `x` is now properly initialized with a value and can be compared with `5`, as expected.

Even though `y` is still unused, the Rust compiler will issue a warning but not an error. The initialization of `y` is unnecessary in this context because it is not used later in the code, but to strictly adhere to your requirement of "the least amount of modification," it has been initialized.

A more idiomatic way to handle unused variables in Rust is to prefix the variable name with an underscore, which tells the Rust compiler that you know the variable is unused:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 5;
    let _y: i32 = 0; // Warning avoided by using _ prefix

    assert_eq!(x, 5);
    println!("Success!");
}
```

In this version, `_y` is marked as intentionally unused, and the Rust compiler won't emit any warning about it.

---

2. ðŸŒŸ Use `mut` to mark a variable as mutable.

Question:

```rust
fn main() {
    let __ __ = 1;
    __ += 2; 
    
    assert_eq!(x, 3);
    println!("Success!");
}
```

In this question, it looks like we're trying to create a variable, increase its value by 2, and then assert that its value is 3. The blanks should be filled with the variable's identifier and type. 

The corrected version of the code would look like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 1; // Initialized variable 'x' with mut keyword
    x += 2; // add 2 to 'x'
    
    assert_eq!(x, 3);
    println!("Success!");
}
```

To break down the changes:

- `let mut x`: Here `mut` keyword allows `x` to be mutable (its value can be changed). If `mut` is omitted, `x` will be immutable and you will get a compiler error when trying to change its value.
- `x += 2;`: Here, we increment `x` by 2. The `+=` operator is shorthand for "add to the current value." In this case, `x += 2;` is equivalent to `x = x + 2;`.
- `assert_eq!(x, 3);`: This line verifies that `x` is indeed 3. If `x` is not 3, the `assert_eq!` macro will cause the program to panic and exit.

By filling in the blanks, we create a mutable variable `x`, increment it, and then verify that it has the expected value. The program then prints "Success!" to indicate it has finished successfully.

### [Scope](https://practice.rs/variables.html#scope)

3. ðŸŒŸ

   Question:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 10;
    {
        let y: i32 = 5;
        println!("The value of x is {} and value of y is {}", x, y);
    }
    println!("The value of x is {} and value of y is {}", x, y); 
}
```

This code has a scope issue. The variable `y` is defined inside a block, and its scope is limited to this block only. It does not exist outside the block, hence the error when it's used in the second `println!` statement. The solution here is to remove `y` from the second `println!` statement. Here is the corrected code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 10;
    {
        let y: i32 = 5;
        println!("The value of x is {} and value of y is {}", x, y);
    }
    println!("The value of x is {}", x); 
}
```

In this corrected version, `y` is not accessed outside of its block, so there's no scope error. 

To explain this further, in Rust, the scope of a variable starts from where it's declared and continues until the end of the current blockâ€”that is, until the nearest closing curly bracket `}`. In the initial version of the code, `y` is declared inside the inner block (the block within the `{}` after `let x: i32 = 10;`). Therefore, `y` is only valid within that inner block. It's not valid in the outer block, where the second `println!` is located. This is why the compiler throws an error.

The scope rules in Rust are designed to provide memory safety without requiring a garbage collector. Once a variable goes out of scope, Rust automatically frees the memory it was using, without needing to manually deallocate it or wait for a garbage collector to clean it up. This design helps to prevent common programming bugs, such as dangling pointers and data races.

4. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

Question:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("{}, world", x); 
}

fn define_x() {
    let x = "hello";
}
```

In this question, the `x` variable is used inside the `main` function, but it's actually defined inside the `define_x` function. In Rust, variables have their own scope that is limited to the block they are defined in, hence `x` is not accessible from `main`.

Moreover, even if the scope was correct, the `define_x` function doesn't return any value, which means we cannot get the value of `x` from this function.

One way to fix this code is to make `define_x` return a string that can then be printed inside `main`. Here is how you can modify the code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = define_x(); // calling the function and assigning the return value to x
    println!("{}, world", x); 
}

fn define_x() -> &'static str { // The function is now defined to return a static string reference
    let x = "hello";
    x // returning x
}
```

Here's what changed:

- `define_x()` now returns a `&'static str`. This means it returns a string slice (`str`) that is statically allocated (i.e., it's part of the program's binary and exists for the entire duration of the program).
- Inside `define_x()`, after `let x = "hello";`, `x` is returned as the result of the function.
- In `main()`, we call `define_x()`, and assign its result to `x`.

As a result of these modifications, `x` is defined and initialized in `main()` by calling `define_x()`. This makes `x` accessible within `main()`, allowing the `println!` macro to work correctly.

### [Shadowing](https://practice.rs/variables.html#shadowing)

You can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable, here we can say **the first one is shadowed by the second one.**

5. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
Question:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 5;
    {
        let x = 12;
        assert_eq!(x, 5);
    }

    assert_eq!(x, 12);

    let x = 42;
    println!("{}", x); // Prints "42".
}
```

In the given code, `assert_eq!(x, 5);` will fail because the `x` inside the inner block is shadowing the `x` outside of the block. Shadowing means that we declare a new variable with the same name, `x` in this case, and it overrides the previous variable in its scope. So, the `x` inside the block is a different variable from the `x` outside of the block.

In the inner block, `x` is 12, not 5. Therefore, `assert_eq!(x, 5);` will panic. The correct code is:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 5;
    {
        let x = 12;
        assert_eq!(x, 12);
    }

    assert_eq!(x, 5);

    let x = 42;
    println!("{}", x); // Prints "42".
}
```

Now, `assert_eq!(x, 12);` matches the value of `x` inside the inner block, and `assert_eq!(x, 5);` matches the value of `x` in the outer block. 

In the final section, `x` is redeclared again as `42`, and then printed out. This `x` is a new variable, separate from the other `x` variables earlier in the code. This is an example of how Rust allows shadowing of variables. It is particularly useful when you want to change the type of a variable but reuse the same name. Here, `x` first holds an `i32`, but then it's shadowed to hold another `i32` without any type issues.

6. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

Question:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x: i32 = 1;
    x = 7;
    // Shadowing and re-binding
    let x = x; 
    x += 3;

    let y = 4;
    // Shadowing
    let y = "I can also be bound to text!"; 

    println!("Success!");
}
```

In this code, there's a variable, `x`, which is declared mutable and then re-declared (or shadowed) as an immutable variable. The line `x += 3;` then attempts to mutate `x` after it has been made immutable by shadowing. This results in a compilation error because the `x` being referred to at that point is immutable. 

To fix the code, we can remove the line `let x = x;` which will keep `x` as a mutable variable:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x: i32 = 1;
    x = 7;
    // Shadowing and re-binding removed
    x += 3;

    let y = 4;
    // Shadowing
    let y = "I can also be bound to text!"; 

    println!("Success!");
}
```

In this corrected version, `x` remains mutable throughout, so `x += 3;` is valid and the code compiles.

As a note, in Rust, you can shadow a variable, which lets you reuse the name with a new value and possibly a new type. This is done with another `let` statement. However, unless you use the `mut` keyword, the shadowed variable is immutable, and you can't modify its value as we were trying to do in the original code. In this corrected version, we avoided shadowing `x`, so `x` remains mutable and can be modified.

### [Unused variables](https://practice.rs/variables.html#unused-variables)


7. Fix the warning below with :
	- ðŸŒŸ Only one solution
	- ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Two distinct solutions

Question:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 1; 
}
// Warning: unused variable: `x`
```

In this code, the variable `x` is declared and assigned a value but it's not used anywhere in the code. This is why the compiler is providing a warning about an unused variable.

The Rust compiler warns about unused variables because they are often a sign of a bug in the code. For example, you might have meant to use `x` in some calculation but forgot to do so, or perhaps `x` is left over from an earlier version of the code and should now be removed. 

To fix this warning, you should either use the variable in your code or remove it if it's not necessary. Here's a simple example of how you might use `x`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 1;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

In this version, `x` is used in a `println!` statement, so there's no warning about an unused variable. The program will now print "The value of x is: 1".

It's important to take note of these warnings because, while your code may still compile and run with warnings, they often indicate potential issues with your code that could lead to bugs or other unintended behavior. While in some cases, such as this one, the issue is relatively harmless, in other cases it could indicate a more serious problem.

---

### [Destructuring](https://practice.rs/variables.html#destructuring)

8. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ We can use a pattern with `let` to destructure a tuple to separate variables.

Question:

```rust
fn main() {
    let (x, y) = (1, 2);
    x += 2;

    assert_eq!(x, 3);
    assert_eq!(y, 2);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

In this code, the variables `x` and `y` are declared and initialized using a tuple, but then there is an attempt to mutate `x` with the line `x += 2;`. This results in a compilation error, as `x` is not declared as mutable (`mut`).

There are two ways to fix this, depending on whether we want to use shadowing or mutability. 

If we want to use mutability, we need to declare `x` as mutable. Here's how we can do that:

```rust
fn main() {
    let (mut x, y) = (1, 2); // make x mutable
    x += 2;

    assert_eq!(x, 3);
    assert_eq!(y, 2);

    println!("Success!");
}
```
In this version, `x` is mutable, so `x += 2;` is valid and the code compiles and runs successfully.

If we want to use shadowing, we can redeclare `x` to effectively create a new variable with the same name. Here's how we can do that:

```rust
fn main() {
    let (x, y) = (1, 2);
    let x = x + 2; // shadow x with a new value

    assert_eq!(x, 3);
    assert_eq!(y, 2);

    println!("Success!");
}
```
In this version, we've shadowed `x` with a new `x` that holds the value of the original `x` plus 2. This way, the original `x` remains immutable, but we can still achieve the desired result. The `assert_eq!(x, 3);` statement is now true, so the program prints "Success!" without any compilation error.

### [Destructuring assignments](https://practice.rs/variables.html#destructuring-assignments)

Introduced in Rust 1.59: You can now use tuple, slice, and struct patterns as the left-hand side of an assignment.

9. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

Question:

```rust
fn main() {
    let (x, y);
    (x,..) = (3, 4);
    [.., y] = [1, 2];
    // Fill the blank to make the code work
    assert_eq!([x,y], __);

    println!("Success!");
} 
```

The above Rust code snippet is using destructuring assignment and pattern matching to assign values to `x` and `y`. The line `(x,..) = (3, 4);` assigns the value `3` to `x`. The line `[.., y] = [1, 2];` assigns the value `2` to `y`. The two dots before or after the variable (..) represent the rest of the elements that we're not interested in.

In the line `assert_eq!([x,y], __);`, we need to fill in the blank with an array that equals to the array `[x,y]` for the `assert_eq!` macro to pass. As `x` equals to `3` and `y` equals to `2`, we can fill the blank with `[3,2]`. Here's the fixed code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let (x, y);
    (x,..) = (3, 4);
    [.., y] = [1, 2];
    // Fill the blank to make the code work
    assert_eq!([x,y], [3,2]);

    println!("Success!");
} 
```
Now the `assert_eq!` macro will pass, as `[x,y]` is equal to `[3,2]`, and the program will print "Success!". The fixed code compiles and runs successfully. 

Rust's pattern matching allows for complex data deconstruction. This can be very useful when dealing with tuples, arrays, structs or enums, as you can extract the data you need and ignore the rest. The `..` syntax in Rust patterns is used to ignore the parts of data we are not interested in.
