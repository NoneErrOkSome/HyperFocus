1. ðŸŒŸ Elements in a tuple can have different types. Tuple's type signature is `(T1, T2, ...)`, where `T1`, `T2` are the types of tuple's members.
   
**Question:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let _t0: (u8,i16) = (0, -1);
    // Tuples can be tuple's members
    let _t1: (u8, (i16, u32)) = (0, (-1, 1));
    // Fill the blanks to make the code work
    let t: (u8, __, i64, __, __) = (1u8, 2u16, 3i64, "hello", String::from(", world"));

    println!("Success!");
}
```

This question is about tuples in Rust. A tuple is a collection of values of potentially different types. It is represented as a comma-separated list enclosed in parentheses, `(T1, T2, ..., Tn)`, where `T1`, `T2`, ..., `Tn` are types of the tuple's members. Tuples can also be nested.

The code here creates two tuples, `_t0` and `_t1`, of different types. It then tries to create a tuple `t` with five elements of different types. The types are `u8`, `i16`, `i64`, `&str`, and `String`.

**Answer:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let _t0: (u8,i16) = (0, -1);
    // Tuples can be tuple's members
    let _t1: (u8, (i16, u32)) = (0, (-1, 1));
    // Fill the blanks to make the code work
    let t: (u8, u16, i64, &str, String) = (1u8, 2u16, 3i64, "hello", String::from(", world"));

    println!("Success!");
}
```

In this corrected code, the tuple `t` is of type `(u8, u16, i64, &str, String)`. This tuple type matches the values being assigned to `t`: `(1u8, 2u16, 3i64, "hello", String::from(", world"))`. The tuple consists of an 8-bit unsigned integer, a 16-bit unsigned integer, a 64-bit signed integer, a string slice, and a string.

2. ðŸŒŸ Members can be extracted from the tuple using indexing.

   **Question:**

```rust
// Make it work
fn main() {
    let t = ("i", "am", "sunface");
    assert_eq!(t.1, "sunface");

    println!("Success!");
}
```

This question is asking about the syntax for accessing elements of a tuple in Rust. The specific scenario is accessing the second element of the tuple `t` (note that tuple indexing starts from 0). Currently, the code tries to assert that the second element is "sunface", but this assertion fails because the second element of the tuple is actually "am".

**Answer:**

```rust
// Make it work
fn main() {
    let t = ("i", "am", "sunface");
    assert_eq!(t.2, "sunface");

    println!("Success!");
}
```

In the corrected code, we use `t.2` instead of `t.1` to access the third element of the tuple `t`. Tuples are zero-indexed in Rust, which means the first element is accessed with `0`, the second element with `1`, and so forth. Therefore, to access the element "sunface", we use the index `2`. This allows the `assert_eq!` macro to correctly assert that the third element of the tuple `t` is "sunface".

3. ðŸŒŸ Long tuples cannot be printed
   
**Question:**

```rust
// Fix the error
fn main() {
    let too_long_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13);
    println!("too long tuple: {:?}", too_long_tuple);
}
```

In Rust, there's a limitation on tuples when it comes to using the `Debug` trait (needed for formatting the tuple using the `{:?}` specifier in `println!`): it only works for tuples up to a size of 12. This means that you can't directly print a tuple that contains more than 12 elements using `{:?}`. The tuple in this code, `too_long_tuple`, has 13 elements, which is why the code doesn't compile.

**Answer:**

One simple way to get around this limitation is to break down the long tuple into smaller tuples that each contain 12 or fewer elements:

```rust
fn main() {
    let too_long_tuple = ((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), 13);
    println!("too long tuple: {:?}", too_long_tuple);
}
```

Here, `too_long_tuple` is a tuple with two elements: the first is a tuple of 12 integers, and the second is the integer 13. This way, you can still group the 13 values together in a single tuple, but you avoid hitting the limitation on the size of tuples that can be printed with `{:?}`.

4. ðŸŒŸ Destructuring tuple with pattern.
   
**Question:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let (x, y, z);

    // Fill the blank
    __ = (1, 2, 3);
    
    assert_eq!(x, 3);
    assert_eq!(y, 1);
    assert_eq!(z, 2);

    println!("Success!");
}
```
In the given code snippet, you have to fill the blank such that it assigns the values 3, 1, 2 to `x`, `y`, `z` respectively. In Rust, this kind of assignment operation can be achieved through destructuring tuples.

**Answer:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let (x, y, z);

    // Fill the blank
    (y, z, x) = (1, 2, 3);
    
    assert_eq!(x, 3);
    assert_eq!(y, 1);
    assert_eq!(z, 2);

    println!("Success!");
}
```
In the above code, `(y, z, x) = (1, 2, 3);` is a destructuring assignment. This means that we are assigning `1` to `y`, `2` to `z`, and `3` to `x` all in one go. This is a handy feature of Rust that lets you assign values to multiple variables at once by matching their position in a tuple.

5. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Destructor assignments.

**Question:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let (x, y, z);

    // Fill the blank
    __ = (1, 2, 3);
    
    assert_eq!(x, 3);
    assert_eq!(y, 1);
    assert_eq!(z, 2);

    println!("Success!");
}
```
In the given code snippet, you have to fill the blank such that it assigns the values 3, 1, 2 to `x`, `y`, `z` respectively. In Rust, this kind of assignment operation can be achieved through destructuring tuples.

**Answer:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let (x, y, z);

    // Fill the blank
    (y, z, x) = (1, 2, 3);
    
    assert_eq!(x, 3);
    assert_eq!(y, 1);
    assert_eq!(z, 2);

    println!("Success!");
}
```
In the above code, `(y, z, x) = (1, 2, 3);` is a destructuring assignment. This means that we are assigning `1` to `y`, `2` to `z`, and `3` to `x` all in one go. This is a handy feature of Rust that lets you assign values to multiple variables at once by matching their position in a tuple.

6. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Tuples can be used as function arguments and return values

**Question:**

```rust
fn main() {
    // Fill the blank, need a few computations here.
    let (x, y) = sum_multiply(__);

    assert_eq!(x, 5);
    assert_eq!(y, 6);

    println!("Success!");
}

fn sum_multiply(nums: (i32, i32)) -> (i32, i32) {
    (nums.0 + nums.1, nums.0 * nums.1)
}
```
In this code, you have a function `sum_multiply` that takes a tuple of two `i32` numbers, returns a tuple with the sum and the product of the two numbers. In the main function, you have to pass a tuple to `sum_multiply` such that it returns `(5, 6)`.

**Answer:**

```rust
fn main() {
    // Fill the blank, need a few computations here.
    let (x, y) = sum_multiply((2, 3));

    assert_eq!(x, 5);
    assert_eq!(y, 6);

    println!("Success!");
}

fn sum_multiply(nums: (i32, i32)) -> (i32, i32) {
    (nums.0 + nums.1, nums.0 * nums.1)
}
```
In the above code, `(2, 3)` is passed to the `sum_multiply` function. Inside the function, `nums.0 + nums.1` calculates the sum of `2` and `3` which equals `5`, and `nums.0 * nums.1` calculates the product of `2` and `3` which equals `6`. Thus the function returns `(5, 6)` and these values are assigned to `x` and `y` respectively.
