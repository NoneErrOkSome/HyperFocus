Your question is:

```rust
// Make it work
use std::mem::size_of_val;
fn main() {
    let c1 = 'a';
    assert_eq!(size_of_val(&c1),1); 

    let c2 = 'ä¸­';
    assert_eq!(size_of_val(&c2),3); 

    println!("Success!");
} 
```

To understand and solve this problem, you need to have knowledge about the Rust `char` type, the `std::mem::size_of_val` function, and the representation of Unicode characters.

Here is the working version of your code:

```rust
use std::mem::size_of_val;
fn main() {
    let c1 = 'a';
    assert_eq!(size_of_val(&c1), 4);  // Rust's char is 4 bytes

    let c2 = 'ä¸­';
    assert_eq!(size_of_val(&c2), 4);  // This applies to all Unicode Scalar Values

    println!("Success!");
}
```
In Rust, `char` is a 4-byte type. It represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which can be more than a single byte. Therefore, the size of both 'a' and 'ä¸­' is 4 bytes when they are represented as `char` in Rust.

Your question is:

```rust
// Make it work
fn main() {
    let c1 = "ä¸­";
    print_char(c1);
} 

fn print_char(c : char) {
    println!("{}", c);
}
```

The issue with your code is that you're trying to pass a string slice (`&str`) where a `char` is expected in the `print_char` function. Rust differentiates between `char` and `&str`, with `char` representing a single Unicode scalar value, and `&str` representing a string slice that can hold multiple `char`s.

To make your code work, you need to change the type of `c1` to `char` and enclose `ä¸­` in single quotes ('') instead of double quotes ("").

Here is the working version of your code:

```rust
// Make it work
fn main() {
    let c1 = 'ä¸­';
    print_char(c1);
} 

fn print_char(c : char) {
    println!("{}", c);
}
```

In this corrected version, `c1` is a `char`, so it can be passed to the `print_char` function without any issues.

Bool

Your question is:

```rust
// Make println! work
fn main() {
    let _f: bool = false;

    let t = true;
    if !t {
        println!("Success!");
    }
}
```

In your code, the `println!` function is inside an `if` block that is only entered if the boolean variable `t` is `false`. However, `t` is actually `true`, so the `println!` statement is never executed. 

To fix this issue and make the `println!` function execute, we need to invert the value of `t` when evaluating the `if` condition. We can do this with the logical NOT operator `!`, which inverts a boolean value.

Here is the corrected version of your code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let _f: bool = false;

    let t = true;
    if !t {
        // This will not be printed as !t is false
    } else {
        // As t is true, we enter here and print "Success!"
        println!("Success!");
    }
}
```

In this corrected version, we add an `else` branch to the `if` statement that will be executed if `t` is `true`. Since `t` is indeed `true`, the `println!` statement in the `else` branch is executed and "Success!" is printed to the console.

Your question is:

```rust
// Make it work
fn main() {
    let f = true;
    let t = true && false;
    assert_eq!(t, f);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

The code is failing because it's trying to assert that `t` (which is `false` due to the `true && false` expression) is equal to `f` (which is `true`). Since `true` and `false` are not equal, the assertion fails and the program panics.

To make the program work, you either need to ensure that both `t` and `f` are `true`, or both `t` and `f` are `false`. Here's an example where both are `false`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let f = false;
    let t = true && false;
    assert_eq!(t, f);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

In this corrected version, `f` is set to `false` and `t` is `false` because of the `true && false` expression. The assertion now passes, as both `t` and `f` are `false`, and "Success!" is printed to the console.

The `&&` operator is a logical AND. If both operands are `true`, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`. So `true && false` returns `false`. The `assert_eq!` macro checks that two values are equal, and if they are not, the program panics. Therefore, it's important to ensure that `t` and `f` have the same value.

### [Unit type](https://practice.rs/basic-types/char-bool-unit.html#unit-type)

5. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

Your question is:

```rust
// Make it work, don't modify `implicitly_ret_unit` !
fn main() {
    let _v: () = ();

    let v = (2, 3);
    assert_eq!(v, implicitly_ret_unit());

    println!("Success!");
}

fn implicitly_ret_unit() {
    println!("I will return a ()");
}

// Don't use this one
fn explicitly_ret_unit() -> () {
    println!("I will return a ()");
}
```

The code is trying to compare a tuple `(2, 3)` with the result of the `implicitly_ret_unit()` function, which is `()`. Since a tuple and a unit type `()` are not the same, the assertion fails.

Since you have explicitly mentioned not to modify `implicitly_ret_unit()`, I assume you want to modify the assertion in the `main()` function.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let v: () = ();

    assert_eq!(v, implicitly_ret_unit());

    println!("Success!");
}

fn implicitly_ret_unit() {
    println!("I will return a ()");
}
```

In this version, we have changed `v` in the `main()` function to be of unit type `()`, the same as the return type of `implicitly_ret_unit()`. Now, the assertion checks if `()` equals `()`, which is true, so the assertion passes and "Success!" is printed to the console.

In Rust, when a function doesn't include a return statement, it implicitly returns a unit type `()`. This is what `implicitly_ret_unit()` is doing. It's essentially a function that does nothing and returns nothing, represented by `()`.

---

ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ What's the size of the unit type?

Your question is:

```rust
// Modify `4` in assert to make it work
use std::mem::size_of_val;
fn main() {
    let unit: () = ();
    assert!(size_of_val(&unit) == 4);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

In this code, `size_of_val(&unit)` is used to find the size in bytes of the variable `unit`. The variable `unit` is of type `()`, which is the unit type in Rust and it does not hold any value and, as such, doesn't occupy any space. Therefore, the size of `unit` is 0, not 4.

To make this work, you need to modify `4` to `0` in the `assert!` macro, like so:

```rust
use std::mem::size_of_val;
fn main() {
    let unit: () = ();
    assert!(size_of_val(&unit) == 0);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

In this modified version, we are correctly asserting that the size of `unit` is `0`, which is true. Thus, the assertion passes, and the program prints "Success!".

The function `size_of_val` is used to find the size of the value that a variable holds. It is important to understand that the size of different types of values can vary. For example, a `u32` will have a size of 4 bytes, while a `()` (unit type) has a size of 0 bytes.
