Your question is:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Don't modify the following two lines!
    let (x, y) = (1, 2);
    let s = sum(x, y);

    assert_eq!(s, 3);

    println!("Success!");
}

fn sum(x, y: i32) {
    x + y;
}
```

The problem with this code lies in the `sum` function. In Rust, function parameters need to have their types specified, and the return type should also be indicated. The function `sum` in your code doesn't specify the type for parameter `x`, and it doesn't have a return type.

Here's the corrected code:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Don't modify the following two lines!
    let (x, y) = (1, 2);
    let s = sum(x, y);

    assert_eq!(s, 3);

    println!("Success!");
}

fn sum(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    x + y
}
```

In this corrected code, both parameters of the `sum` function are specified as `i32` type. The function is also declared to return an `i32` type. Finally, the semicolon is removed from `x + y` in the `sum` function to make it an expression (which returns a value) rather than a statement (which doesn't return a value).

Your question is:

```rust
fn main() {
   print();
}

// Replace i32 with another type
fn print() -> i32 {
   println!("Success!");
}
```

The `println!` macro doesn't return a value, so the function `print` can't return an `i32` as indicated in your code. Instead, it should return `()`, which represents the unit type. The unit type is used when there's no other meaningful value that a function could return. 

Here's the corrected code:

```rust
fn main() {
   print();
}

// Replace i32 with another type
fn print() {
   println!("Success!");
}
```

In this corrected code, the `print` function is declared to return nothing. The `println!` macro prints "Success!" to the console, and since it doesn't return a value, the `print` function doesn't have a return value either.

Your question is:

```rust
// Solve it in two ways
// DON'T let `println!` works
fn main() {
    never_return();

    println!("Failed!");
}

fn never_return() -> ! {
    // Implement this function, don't modify the fn signatures   
}
```

In Rust, `!` is a special type that means a function will never return. In other words, the function will run forever, or it will terminate the program before it returns. Here are two different ways to write the `never_return` function:

1. Use an infinite loop:

```rust
fn main() {
    never_return();

    println!("Failed!");
}

fn never_return() -> ! {
    loop {}
}
```

In this version, `never_return` contains an infinite loop that will run forever, so it will never return, and `"Failed!"` will never be printed.

2. Use the `panic!` macro to terminate the program:

```rust
fn main() {
    never_return();

    println!("Failed!");
}

fn never_return() -> ! {
    panic!("This function never returns");
}
```

In this version, `never_return` uses the `panic!` macro to terminate the program, so it will never return, and `"Failed!"` will never be printed.

In both versions, the `never_return` function adheres to the `!` return type because it will never return normally.


```rust
Compiling playground v0.0.1 (/playground)

  |
4 |     never_return();
  |     -------------- any code following this expression is unreachable

6 |     println!("Failed!");
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ unreachable statement
  |
  = note: `#[warn(unreachable_code)]` on by default
  = note: this warning originates in the macro `println` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)

thread 'main' panicked at 'This function never returns', src/main.rs:11:5
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

Yes, this is correct and expected output. 

The warning you're seeing is because the Rust compiler knows that the `println!` statement after `never_return();` in `main` will never be reached because the `never_return()` function is marked with a return type of `!`, meaning it will never return to `main`. Therefore, the `println!("Failed!");` line is unreachable, and the compiler gives a warning.

The error you're seeing, "thread 'main' panicked at 'This function never returns'", is because the `never_return()` function calls `panic!()`, which is a macro that stops normal execution of the program and begins unwinding the stack. The message "This function never returns" is the one you provided to `panic!`.

So the output you're seeing indicates that the code is behaving as expected: `never_return()` is indeed never returning, and it's causing the program to terminate before `println!("Failed!");` can run.

Yes, I'm sure.

The `!` return type in Rust means that the function is diverging, which means it doesn't return normally to the calling function. Common examples of diverging functions are those that panic, enter into an infinite loop, or terminate the program.

When you see a panic message like "thread 'main' panicked at 'This function never returns'", it means that your `never_return()` function is indeed working correctly by panicking and thus not returning normally.

The unreachable code warning for `println!("Failed!");` is also correct and expected. This warning is Rust's static analysis at work: it's smart enough to know that the `println!()` line will never be reached because `never_return()` will cause the program to terminate before it gets there.

So, yes, this is the expected behavior for the code you've provided. It's successfully demonstrating a function with a `!` return type and unreachable code.

### [Diverging functions](https://practice.rs/basic-types/functions.html#diverging-functions)

Diverging functions never return to the caller, so they may be used in places where a value of any type is expected.

Sure, below is your question followed by the answer:

**Question:**

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Success!");
}

fn get_option(tp: u8) -> Option<i32> {
    match tp {
        1 => {
            // TODO
        }
        _ => {
            // TODO
        }
    };
    
    // Rather than returning a None, we use a diverging function instead
    never_return_fn()
}

// IMPLEMENT this function in THREE ways
fn never_return_fn() -> ! {
    
}
```

To solve the above question, you must understand the concept of Diverging Functions in Rust. A diverging function is a function which doesn't return to its caller. 

**Answer:**

Here is the implementation of `never_return_fn` in three different ways:

```rust
// First way to implement the diverging function
fn never_return_fn_1() -> ! {
    panic!("This function never returns");
}

// Second way to implement the diverging function
fn never_return_fn_2() -> ! {
    loop {}
}

// Third way to implement the diverging function
fn never_return_fn_3() -> ! {
    never_return_fn_3()
}
```

The first implementation of `never_return_fn` uses the `panic!` macro to cause the current thread to panic. The second implementation uses an infinite loop with `loop {}` that will never terminate. The third implementation recursively calls itself, which also means it will never return.

To understand and answer this question, you need to have a basic understanding of the following topics:

1. **Diverging Functions in Rust**: In Rust, a diverging function is a function which doesn't return to its caller. The syntax for declaring a diverging function uses `!` after the `->` in the function signature. Diverging functions are also known as functions with a never type. 

2. **Options in Rust**: The Option enum in Rust is a way to use type safety to express the possibility of absence. It has two variants: Some(T) for presence and None for absence.

3. **Match Expressions in Rust**: Match is a control flow structure in Rust that allows you to handle possible cases for a type.

4. **Panic in Rust**: Panic is a macro which causes the current thread to panic. It can be used in a diverging function to make sure the function never returns.

Here is the implementation of `never_return_fn` in three ways:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Success!");
}

fn get_option(tp: u8) -> Option<i32> {
    match tp {
        1 => {
            // TODO
        }
        _ => {
            // TODO
        }
    };
    
    // Rather than returning a None, we use a diverging function instead
    never_return_fn_1()
}

// First way to implement the diverging function
fn never_return_fn_1() -> ! {
    panic!("This function never returns");
}

// Second way to implement the diverging function
fn never_return_fn_2() -> ! {
    loop {}
}

// Third way to implement the diverging function
fn never_return_fn_3() -> ! {
    never_return_fn_3()
}
```

The first implementation of `never_return_fn` uses the `panic!` macro to cause the current thread to panic. 

The second implementation uses an infinite loop with `loop {}` that will never terminate.

The third implementation recursively calls itself, which also means it will never return.

**Question:**

```rust
fn main() {
    // FILL in the blank
    let b = __;

    let _v = match b {
        true => 1,
        // Diverging functions can also be used in match expression to replace a value of any value
        false => {
            println!("Success!");
            panic!("we have no value for `false`, but we can panic");
        }
    };

    println!("Exercise Failed if printing out this line!");
}
```

You need to fill in the blank such that the code runs successfully, i.e., it does not print "Exercise Failed if printing out this line!". In this context, it means that the program should not reach the last `println!` statement. 

**Answer:**

You should fill in the blank with `false`, which leads to the `false` branch of the match expression, triggering the `println!("Success!")` and then `panic!`, which stops execution of the function.

```rust
fn main() {
    let b = false;

    let _v = match b {
        true => 1,
        false => {
            println!("Success!");
            panic!("we have no value for `false`, but we can panic");
        }
    };

    println!("Exercise Failed if printing out this line!");
}
```

In the code above, the match expression takes a boolean value `b`. If `b` is `true`, then it returns 1. If `b` is `false`, then it prints "Success!" and then calls the `panic!` macro which halts execution. So the last line of code is never reached when `b` is `false`.
