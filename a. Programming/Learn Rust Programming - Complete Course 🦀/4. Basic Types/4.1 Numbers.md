Rust has several integer types, each with their own minimum and maximum values. Here are the maximum and minimum values for the basic numeric types in Rust:

Signed integer types:
- i8: min = -128, max = 127
- i16: min = -32,768, max = 32,767
- i32: min = -2,147,483,648, max = 2,147,483,647
- i64: min = -9,223,372,036,854,775,808, max = 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
- i128: min = -170,141,183,460,469,231,731,687,303,715,884,105,728, max = 170,141,183,460,469,231,731,687,303,715,884,105,727
- isize: min and max depends on the host machine. On a 32-bit architecture, this is the same as i32, and on a 64-bit architecture, it's the same as i64.

Unsigned integer types:
- u8: min = 0, max = 255
- u16: min = 0, max = 65,535
- u32: min = 0, max = 4,294,967,295
- u64: min = 0, max = 18,446,744,073,709,551,615
- u128: min = 0, max = 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,455
- usize: min and max depends on the host machine. On a 32-bit architecture, this is the same as u32, and on a 64-bit architecture, it's the same as u64.

Please note that for floating point types (`f32`, `f64`), the range is based on the IEEE 754 standard and it's a bit more complex due to the way that floating point numbers are represented. It's not simply a matter of min and max.

1. ðŸŒŸ
In the provided code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 5;
    let mut y: u32 = 5;

    y = x;
    
    let z = 10; // Type of z ? 

    println!("Success!");
}
```

There is a type mismatch error at `y = x;`. In Rust, you cannot directly assign a value of one type to a variable of another. Here, `x` is of type `i32` (signed 32-bit integer) and `y` is of type `u32` (unsigned 32-bit integer). 

As per the question, we need to remove something to make it work, we can simply remove the line `y = x;`.

The modified code would be:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 5;
    let mut y: u32 = 5;

    // y = x; Removed this line.
    
    let z = 10; // Type of z ? 

    println!("Success!");
}
```

As for the type of `z`, it is inferred by Rust as `i32` since `10` is an integer, and the default integer type is `i32`.

However, if you wanted to keep the assignment `y = x;`, you would need to convert `x` to `u32`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 5;
    let mut y: u32 = 5;

    y = x as u32;  // Explicit type casting.

    let z = 10; // Type of z is i32

    println!("Success!");
}
```

Note that this casting could potentially lead to problems if `x` contains a negative value, because `u32` cannot represent negative numbers.

2. ðŸŒŸ
In the provided code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let v: u16 = 38_u8 as __;

    println!("Success!");
}
```

You are asked to fill in the blank (`__`) with the correct type to make the code run successfully.

The code is trying to cast an `u8` value (`38_u8`) to another type and assign the result to `v`, which is of type `u16`. To make this work, the type in the blank should be `u16`.

Here is the correct code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let v: u16 = 38_u8 as u16;

    println!("Success!");
}
```

This means you are casting the `u8` value `38` to `u16` which is then stored in the variable `v`. This is a safe operation because the `u16` type can represent all values that `u8` can.

---
3. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
The code you've provided:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    assert_eq!("u32".to_string(), type_of(&x));

    println!("Success!");
}

// Get the type of given variable, return a string representation of the type  , e.g "i8", "u8", "i32", "u32"
fn type_of<T>(_: &T) -> String {
    format!("{}", std::any::type_name::<T>())
}
```

This code declares a variable `x` without a type annotation, which means that Rust will infer the type of `x` from the value and how `x` is used. In this case, `x` is assigned the value `5`, which is an integer. By default, Rust infers integers to `i32`, not `u32`.

The `assert_eq!` macro is used to ensure that two values are equal. If they are not equal, the program will panic and print a message about what the two values actually are. 

So, in order to make the assertion pass and hence the program to work, we need to change `"u32"` to `"i32"` as follows:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    assert_eq!("i32".to_string(), type_of(&x));

    println!("Success!");
}

// Get the type of given variable, return a string representation of the type  , e.g "i8", "u8", "i32", "u32"
fn type_of<T>(_: &T) -> String {
    format!("{}", std::any::type_name::<T>())
}
```

In this corrected version of the code, the `assert_eq!` macro checks whether the string representation of `x`'s type equals `"i32"`. If so, the program will print "Success!". If not, the program will panic and stop execution.

4. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
In the given code:

```rust
fn main() {
    assert_eq!(i8::MAX, __); 
    assert_eq!(u8::MAX, __); 

    println!("Success!");
}
```

You're asked to fill in the blanks (`__`) with correct values. Here, `i8::MAX` and `u8::MAX` are used, which represent the maximum values that an `i8` and `u8` can hold respectively. 

For `i8::MAX`, the maximum value is `127`. For `u8::MAX`, the maximum value is `255`. 

So, you should fill in the blanks with these values to make the assertions pass:

```rust
fn main() {
    assert_eq!(i8::MAX, 127); 
    assert_eq!(u8::MAX, 255); 

    println!("Success!");
}
```

In this code, the `assert_eq!` macro checks if the given values are equal to the maximum values of their respective types. If they are, the program will print "Success!". If not, the program will panic and stop execution.

---
5. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
In the given code:

```rust
fn main() {
   let v1 = 251_u8 + 8;
   let v2 = i8::checked_add(251, 8).unwrap();
   println!("{},{}",v1,v2);
}
```

There are a couple of issues. 

Firstly, `251_u8 + 8` attempts to add `8` to `251` but the result (`259`) exceeds the maximum value that a `u8` can hold (`255`). This will cause an overflow error. 

Secondly, `i8::checked_add(251, 8).unwrap()` attempts to add `8` to `251` within the range of an `i8`, which has a maximum value of `127`. The value `251` is already outside the range of `i8`, which leads to a panic when you call `unwrap()` on `None`.

To fix these issues, you need to choose values that do not exceed the maximum values for each type:

```rust
fn main() {
   let v1 = 250_u8.checked_add(5).unwrap_or(u8::MAX);
   let v2 = 120_i8.checked_add(7).unwrap_or(i8::MAX);
   println!("{},{}",v1,v2);
}
```

Here `checked_add` is used which returns `None` if there's an overflow instead of causing a panic, and `unwrap_or(u8::MAX)` and `unwrap_or(i8::MAX)` are used to provide a default value in case of an overflow. This code won't panic and will print "255,127" if there's an overflow for either addition. 

Please note that the values `5` and `7` are arbitrary here. I chose them to avoid overflow while adding to `250_u8` and `120_i8` respectively.

---
6. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
In the provided code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let v = 1_024 + 0xff + 0o77 + 0b1111_1111;
    assert!(v == 1579);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

You're performing addition with different numeral systems:
- `1_024` is a decimal number.
- `0xff` is a hexadecimal number.
- `0o77` is an octal number.
- `0b1111_1111` is a binary number.

The assertion is currently failing because the sum of these numbers isn't `1579`.

In decimal, `0xff` is `255`, `0o77` is `63`, and `0b1111_1111` is `255`. 

So, the correct total sum of `1_024`, `0xff`, `0o77`, and `0b1111_1111` is `1_024 + 255 + 63 + 255 = 1597`, not `1579`.

To fix the issue, you need to change `1579` to `1597` in the `assert!` macro:

```rust
fn main() {
    let v = 1_024 + 0xff + 0o77 + 0b1111_1111;
    assert!(v == 1597);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

Now the `assert!` macro checks whether `v` equals `1597` and the assertion passes, so the program will print "Success!". If not, the program will panic and stop execution.

Floating-Point
7. ðŸŒŸ
---
In the provided code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 1_000.000_1; // ?
    let y: f32 = 0.12; // f32
    let z = 0.01_f64; // f64

    assert_eq!(type_of(&x), "__".to_string());
    println!("Success!");
}

fn type_of<T>(_: &T) -> String {
    format!("{}", std::any::type_name::<T>())
}
```

You're trying to figure out the type of `x` and confirm it in the `assert_eq!` function.

In Rust, if you don't explicitly annotate a floating-point number's type, the compiler will infer it as `f64`. This is because `f64` (64-bit floating-point number) is the default type for floating-point numbers in Rust. So, `x` is of type `f64`.

To make the assertion pass, you should replace `__` with `"f64"`, as follows:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 1_000.000_1; // ?
    let y: f32 = 0.12; // f32
    let z = 0.01_f64; // f64

    assert_eq!(type_of(&x), "f64".to_string());
    println!("Success!");
}

fn type_of<T>(_: &T) -> String {
    format!("{}", std::any::type_name::<T>())
}
```

This code will output "Success!" if the type of `x` is indeed `f64`. If not, the program will panic and stop execution.

8. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Make it work in two distinct ways
---
Apologies for the oversight. Let's amend that.

You asked:

```rust
fn main() {
    assert!(0.1+0.2==0.3);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

The provided code is asserting that the result of adding `0.1` and `0.2` is exactly `0.3`. However, due to the way floating point numbers are represented internally by the system, this isn't always the case. 

Specifically, the binary representation of `0.1` and `0.2` aren't exactly `0.1` and `0.2`, and their sum doesn't exactly equal `0.3`. This is a common issue not just in Rust, but in many programming languages, due to the way floating point numbers are represented in binary.

I apologize for the confusion. You're correct, and the code should specify the type of the numbers to disambiguate. The compiler defaults to `f64` for floating point literals, but when the operations get more complex, it may not be able to infer the types.

Here's the corrected code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = 0.1_f64 + 0.2_f64;
    let b = 0.3_f64;
    let diff = (a - b).abs();
    assert!(diff < 1e-10);  // Replace 1e-10 with any tolerance level appropriate for your case.

    println!("Success!");
}
```

In this version of the code, `0.1_f64`, `0.2_f64`, and `0.3_f64` specify that these literals should be `f64`. The `abs` function is now unambiguous because it is being called on a value of a known type, `f64`. 

This code will print "Success!" if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is less than `1e-10`. If not, the program will panic and stop execution.

---
Apologies for the oversight. Here's the corrected response with your question included:

You provided the following code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut sum = 0;
    for i in -3..2 {
        sum += i
    }

    assert!(sum == -3);

    for c in 'a'..='z' {
        println!("{}",c);
    }
}
```

The provided code has two main parts. 

In the first part, the code is calculating the sum of numbers from `-3` to `1` (exclusive of `2`) using a `for` loop. The range `-3..2` in Rust includes `-3`, `-2`, `-1`, `0`, and `1`. These numbers sum up to `-5`, not `-3`. So, the assertion `assert!(sum == -3);` will fail and cause the program to panic. You would need to adjust this to `assert!(sum == -5);` for the assertion to pass.

The second part of the code is printing all lowercase English letters from `a` to `z` inclusive, one letter per line. This uses the range `'a'..='z'` (inclusive of `'z'`) and works as intended.

Here's the corrected code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut sum = 0;
    for i in -3..2 {
        sum += i;
    }

    assert!(sum == -5);  // Corrected the expected sum.

    for c in 'a'..='z' {
        println!("{}", c);
    }
}
```

This corrected version will calculate the sum correctly and print all lowercase English letters from `a` to `z` as expected, without panicking.

10. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
Your question is:

```rust
use std::ops::{Range, RangeInclusive};
fn main() {
    assert_eq!((1..__), Range{ start: 1, end: 5 });
    assert_eq!((1..__), RangeInclusive::new(1, 5));

    println!("Success!");
}
```

You're asking to fill in the blanks to make the two `assert_eq!` statements correct. In Rust, `..` is used to create a range, which is a series of values with a start and an end. 

The first range `(1..__)` needs to match with `Range{ start: 1, end: 5 }`. In Rust, the end of a `Range` is exclusive, meaning that it should be one more than the last desired value. Therefore, to create a `Range` object from 1 up to but not including 5, the blank should be filled with `5`.

The second range `(1..__)` needs to match with `RangeInclusive::new(1, 5)`. In Rust, `..=` is used to create an inclusive range, which includes the end value. Therefore, to create a `RangeInclusive` object from 1 up to and including 5, the blank should be filled with `=5`.

Here is the corrected code:

```rust
use std::ops::{Range, RangeInclusive};
fn main() {
    assert_eq!((1..5), Range{ start: 1, end: 5 });
    assert_eq!((1..=5), RangeInclusive::new(1, 5));

    println!("Success!");
}
```

You've asked to fill in the blanks and fix the errors in the following Rust code:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Integer addition
    assert!(1u32 + 2 == __);

    // Integer subtraction
    assert!(1i32 - 2 == __);
    assert!(1u8 - 2 == -1); 
    
    assert!(3 * 50 == __);

    assert!(9.6 / 3.2 == 3.0); // error ! make it work

    assert!(24 % 5 == __);
    // Short-circuiting boolean logic
    assert!(true && false == __);
    assert!(true || false == __);
    assert!(!true == __);

    // Bitwise operations
    println!("0011 AND 0101 is {:04b}", 0b0011u32 & 0b0101);
    println!("0011 OR 0101 is {:04b}", 0b0011u32 | 0b0101);
    println!("0011 XOR 0101 is {:04b}", 0b0011u32 ^ 0b0101);
    println!("1 << 5 is {}", 1u32 << 5);
    println!("0x80 >> 2 is 0x{:x}", 0x80u32 >> 2);
}
```

I apologize for the confusion earlier. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert!((9.6f64 / 3.2f64 - 3.0f64).abs() < std::f64::EPSILON);` failed. This is likely due to the `EPSILON` constant in the standard library being too small for this comparison, as it is meant to represent the smallest difference that can be represented between two `f64` numbers, not a general purpose tolerance for floating point comparisons.

To fix this, we need to specify a higher tolerance level:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Integer addition
    assert!(1u32 + 2 == 3);

    // Integer subtraction
    assert!(1i32 - 2 == -1);
    // Fix: use wrapping_sub for correct wrapping behavior on unsigned integer underflow.
    assert!(1u8.wrapping_sub(2) == 255); 
    
    assert!(3 * 50 == 150);

    // Compare floating point numbers using a small tolerance to avoid precision errors.
    assert!((9.6f64 / 3.2f64 - 3.0f64).abs() < 1e-10);

    assert!(24 % 5 == 4);

    // Short-circuiting boolean logic
    assert!(true && false == false);
    assert!(true || false == true);
    assert!(!true == false);

    // Bitwise operations
    println!("0011 AND 0101 is {:04b}", 0b0011u32 & 0b0101);
    println!("0011 OR 0101 is {:04b}", 0b0011u32 | 0b0101);
    println!("0011 XOR 0101 is {:04b}", 0b0011u32 ^ 0b0101);
    println!("1 << 5 is {}", 1u32 << 5);
    println!("0x80 >> 2 is 0x{:x}", 0x80u32 >> 2);
}
```

Here, I've replaced `std::f64::EPSILON` with `1e-10`, which is a more reasonable tolerance level for this comparison.
