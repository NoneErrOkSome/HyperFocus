Your question is:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5u32;

    let y = {
        let x_squared = x * x;
        let x_cube = x_squared * x;

        // This expression will be assigned to `y`
        x_cube + x_squared + x
    };

    let z = {
        // The semicolon suppresses this expression and `()` is assigned to `z`
        2 * x;
    };

    println!("x is {:?}", x);
    println!("y is {:?}", y);
    println!("z is {:?}", z);
}
```

In this Rust code, we are demonstrating how expressions and assignments work in Rust. The `main` function declares three variables: `x`, `y`, and `z`. The variable `x` is simply assigned a value, while `y` and `z` are assigned the result of a block of code.

In Rust, a block of code is an expression, and the result of the last expression in the block (without a semicolon at the end) is used as the value of the block. Here, `y` is assigned the value of `x_cube + x_squared + x`.

For `z`, however, the expression `2 * x` is followed by a semicolon. This makes it a statement, not an expression. The result of the block is now `()`, the unit type, since a statement does not return a value. Therefore, `z` is assigned the unit type `()`.

To "make it work" I assume you want `z` to be assigned the value of `2 * x`, for this you can remove the semicolon after `2 * x`. Here's how:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5u32;

    let y = {
        let x_squared = x * x;
        let x_cube = x_squared * x;

        // This expression will be assigned to `y`
        x_cube + x_squared + x
    };

    let z = {
        // The semicolon is removed to make this an expression and its value is assigned to `z`
        2 * x
    };

    println!("x is {:?}", x);
    println!("y is {:?}", y);
    println!("z is {:?}", z);
}
```

In this modified version, `z` is assigned the value of `2 * x`, which is `10`. So, the output of this program will be:

```
x is 5
y is 155
z is 10
```

Your question is:

```rust
// Make it work with two ways
fn main() {
   let v = {
       let mut x = 1;
       x += 2
   };

   assert_eq!(v, 3);

   println!("Success!");
}
```

In this Rust code, you are creating a mutable variable `x` within a block and incrementing its value. Then, you want to assign the final value of `x` to `v`. Rust considers the final expression in a block (without a semicolon) as the return value of the block. This value is then assigned to `v`.

However, the expression `x += 2` is a statement, not an expression. So, it doesn't return a value. Therefore, the block doesn't have a return value and `v` is assigned `()`, the unit type.

Here are two ways to make the code work:

1. Add `x` as the final expression in the block. This will return the updated value of `x` from the block.

```rust
fn main() {
   let v = {
       let mut x = 1;
       x += 2;
       x
   };

   assert_eq!(v, 3);

   println!("Success!");
}
```

2. Change `x += 2` to `x = x + 2`, which is an expression that returns a value.

```rust
fn main() {
   let v = {
       let mut x = 1;
       x = x + 2
   };

   assert_eq!(v, 3);

   println!("Success!");
}
```

Both ways will assign `3` to `v` and the assertion will pass, printing "Success!" to the console.

In Rust, as well as in many other programming languages, a program's execution flow is determined by statements and expressions. They have different purposes and are identified differently in the code.

**Statements** are instructions that perform some action but don't produce a value. They are equivalent to sentences in natural languages. In Rust, creating a variable or using a `let` binding without providing a value is a statement.

For example:
```rust
let x;  // A statement
```

**Expressions** evaluate to a value and make up most of the rest of the code that isn't a statement. They are equivalent to phrases in natural languages. Function bodies are made up of a series of expressions. An expression can be part of a statement, like the 5 in `let y = 5;`, which is a statement that contains the expression `5`.

For example:
```rust
5 + 6  // An expression
```

In Rust, if you want to turn an expression into a statement, you can use a semicolon (`;`) at the end. In fact, the difference between a statement and an expression in Rust is that statements do not return a value, while expressions do.

For example:
```rust
let x = (let y = 6);  // This will give an error because `let y = 6` is a statement and does not return a value.
```

Note: In most cases, youâ€™ll want to create variables with a starting value, as weâ€™ve shown in previous examples. If you declare a variable without giving it an initial value, youâ€™ll get a compiler error.

Expressions do not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement, which will then not return a value.

Your question is:

```rust
fn main() {
   let v = (let x = 3);

   assert!(v == 3);

   println!("Success!");
}
```

In Rust, a `let` statement doesn't return a value, so it can't be used as an expression. This means you can't directly assign the result of `let x = 3` to `v`. 

In the code provided, `(let x = 3)` is a `let` statement enclosed in parentheses and it doesn't return a value, hence it cannot be assigned to `v`, causing a compile error.

Here's a corrected version of your code:

```rust
fn main() {
   let x = 3;
   let v = x;

   assert!(v == 3);

   println!("Success!");
}
```

In this corrected code, `x` is assigned the value `3` using a `let` statement. Then, the value of `x` is assigned to `v` and the assertion will pass as `v` is indeed `3`. The code then prints "Success!" to the console.

Your question is:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = sum(1 , 2);
    assert_eq!(s, 3);

    println!("Success!");
}

fn sum(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    x + y;
}
```

In Rust, the last expression in a function is used as its return value, unless it ends with a semicolon (`;`), in which case the return value is `()`. In the `sum` function in your code, `x + y` is followed by a semicolon, which means `sum` is actually returning `()` and not the result of `x + y`. This causes a type mismatch error, as `sum` is specified to return `i32`.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = sum(1 , 2);
    assert_eq!(s, 3);

    println!("Success!");
}

fn sum(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    x + y  // removed semicolon
}
```

In this corrected code, `sum` correctly returns the result of `x + y` because the semicolon after `x + y` has been removed. Therefore, the assertion in the `main` function will pass, and "Success!" will be printed to the console.
