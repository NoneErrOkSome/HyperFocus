**Question:**

In the following Rust code, there's an `enum Direction` with four variants: East, West, North, and South. In the `main()` function, a `Direction` value named `dire` is set to `Direction::South`. This `dire` is used in a `match` expression, where it's expected to match either East, South, North, or a default case. However, there are some blanks in the code that need to be filled.

```rust
enum Direction {
    East,
    West,
    North,
    South,
}

fn main() {
    let dire = Direction::South;
    match dire {
        Direction::East => println!("East"),
        __  => { // Matching South or North here
            println!("South or North");
        },
        _ => println!(__),
    };
}
```

**Answer:**

To fill the blanks in this code, we need to match the `dire` with the South or North variants of the `Direction` enum in the second match arm. In the last match arm, which acts as the default case, we want to print "West" because it's the only variant not handled by the previous match arms. So, the blanks should be filled with `Direction::South | Direction::North` and `"West"` respectively. Here's the completed code:

```rust
enum Direction {
    East,
    West,
    North,
    South,
}

fn main() {
    let dire = Direction::South;
    match dire {
        Direction::East => println!("East"),
        Direction::South | Direction::North => { // Matching South or North here
            println!("South or North");
        },
        _ => println!("West"),
    };
}
```

In this code, the `match` expression is used to pattern-match on the value of `dire`. If `dire` is `Direction::East`, it prints "East". If `dire` is either `Direction::South` or `Direction::North`, it prints "South or North". Finally, for any other values of `dire` (which in this case can only be `Direction::West`), it prints "West". The `_` symbol is a catch-all pattern that matches any value.

2. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Match is an expression, so we can use it in assignments.

**Question:**

In the given Rust code, there is a boolean variable named `boolean` which is set to `true`. Then, there is a variable `binary` that needs to be assigned the value of `1` if `boolean` is `true`, and `0` if `boolean` is `false`. The assignment to `binary` should be done using a `match` expression. However, the `match` expression is missing, indicated by the placeholder `__`. How can we fill in this blank to correctly initialize `binary` based on the value of `boolean`?

```rust
fn main() {
    let boolean = true;

    // Fill the blank with a match expression:
    //
    // boolean = true => binary = 1
    // boolean = false =>  binary = 0
    let binary = __;

    assert_eq!(binary, 1);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

**Answer:**

We can fill the blank with a `match` expression that checks the value of `boolean` and assigns the corresponding binary value to `binary`. Here is how to do it:

```rust
fn main() {
    let boolean = true;

    // Fill the blank with a match expression:
    //
    // boolean = true => binary = 1
    // boolean = false =>  binary = 0
    let binary = match boolean {
        true => 1,
        false => 0,
    };

    assert_eq!(binary, 1);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

In this code, the `match` expression checks the value of `boolean`. If `boolean` is `true`, the `match` expression evaluates to `1`, and if `boolean` is `false`, the `match` expression evaluates to `0`. The result is then assigned to `binary`. Thus, `binary` will hold the value `1` if `boolean` is `true` and `0` if `boolean` is `false`. This fulfills the stated requirement. The `assert_eq!(binary, 1);` line is a test that checks if `binary` is indeed `1`, which it should be since `boolean` is `true`. If `binary` is not `1`, the program will panic at this line. Finally, `"Success!"` is printed to indicate that the program has run without errors.

3. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Using match to get the data an enum variant holds.

   **Question:**

In the given Rust code, an `enum` called `Message` is defined with four variants. Then, an array `msgs` of `Message` objects is created. The program iterates over each `Message` in `msgs` and calls the `show_message` function, passing the current `Message` as an argument. The `show_message` function has a `match` statement to handle each variant of `Message`. However, several parts of the `match` statement are incomplete, indicated by the placeholders `__`. How can we fill in these blanks to correctly match and handle each `Message` variant?

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}

fn main() {
    let msgs = [
        Message::Quit,
        Message::Move{x:1, y:3},
        Message::ChangeColor(255,255,0)
    ];

    for msg in msgs {
        show_message(msg)
    }

    println!("Success!");
} 

fn show_message(msg: Message) {
    match msg {
        __ => { // match  Message::Move
            assert_eq!(a, 1);
            assert_eq!(b, 3);
        },
        Message::ChangeColor(_, g, b) => {
            assert_eq!(g, __);
            assert_eq!(b, __);
        }
        __ => println!("no data in these variants")
    }
}
```

**Answer:**

You can complete the match statement as follows:

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}

fn main() {
    let msgs = [
        Message::Quit,
        Message::Move{x:1, y:3},
        Message::ChangeColor(255,255,0)
    ];

    for msg in &msgs {  // borrow each msg
        show_message(msg)
    }

    println!("Success!");
} 

fn show_message(msg: &Message) {  // use a reference to Message
    match msg {
        Message::Move { x, y } => {  // match Message::Move
            assert_eq!(*x, 1);
            assert_eq!(*y, 3);
        },
        Message::ChangeColor(_, g, b) => {
            assert_eq!(*g, 255);  // fill with 255
            assert_eq!(*b, 0);   // fill with 0
        }
        _ => println!("no data in these variants")  // match other variants
    }
}
```

Here, for `Message::Move` case, you should use `Message::Move { x, y }` to capture the `x` and `y` values in the `Move` variant. Inside the match arm, you should use these `x` and `y` to do the assertion. For `Message::ChangeColor`, you should fill the blanks with the exact values you used in main function which are `255` for `g` and `0` for `b`. For the last arm, you should use `_` to match any other possible variants of `Message`. Because you're only passing a reference of `Message` to `show_message` function, you need to dereference `x`, `y`, `g`, and `b` in the assertions with `*`.

**Question:**

In the given Rust code, an array `alphabets` is defined with several character elements. Then, the program iterates over each character in `alphabets`. Inside the loop, there is an `assert!` function that requires a boolean expression. The `matches!` macro is intended to be used in this expression to check certain conditions for the current character. However, the exact usage of `matches!` is not shown, indicated by the placeholder `__`. How can we fill in this blank to correctly use the `matches!` macro for the intended purpose?

```rust
fn main() {
    let alphabets = ['a', 'E', 'Z', '0', 'x', '9' , 'Y'];

    // Fill the blank with `matches!` to make the code work
    for ab in alphabets {
        assert!(__)
    }

    println!("Success!");
} 
```

**Answer:**

Given the array `alphabets` contains both lowercase and uppercase alphabets and numbers, let's assume we want to assert that each character `ab` is either a lowercase alphabet, an uppercase alphabet, or a number. We can use the `matches!` macro with a range pattern for this:

```rust
fn main() {
    let alphabets = ['a', 'E', 'Z', '0', 'x', '9' , 'Y'];

    for ab in alphabets {
        assert!(matches!(ab, 'a'..='z' | 'A'..='Z' | '0'..='9'))
    }

    println!("Success!");
} 
```

The `matches!` macro here is used to check if the character `ab` falls into one of the specified ranges. The `..=` operator defines a range inclusive of both ends, and the `|` operator combines multiple patterns in a match expression, so `'a'..='z' | 'A'..='Z' | '0'..='9'` matches any lowercase letter, any uppercase letter, or any digit.

**Question:**

In the provided Rust code, an enumeration `MyEnum` is defined with two variants: `Foo` and `Bar`. Then, a vector `v` is created with three elements of `MyEnum`, and a `for` loop is used to iterate over `v`. Within the loop, there is an `if` statement that checks if the current element equals `MyEnum::Foo`, and if so, it increments a counter `count`. However, there's an issue with the condition in the `if` statement: `e == MyEnum::Foo`. How can we correct this error by changing only the mentioned line?

```rust
enum MyEnum {
    Foo,
    Bar
}

fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;

    let v = vec![MyEnum::Foo,MyEnum::Bar,MyEnum::Foo];
    for e in v {
        if e == MyEnum::Foo { // Fix the error by changing only this line
            count += 1;
        }
    }

    assert_eq!(count, 2);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

**Answer:**

The issue with the code lies in the `if` condition `e == MyEnum::Foo`. By default, Rust does not know how to compare enum values using `==`. However, Rust provides pattern matching which is a more idiomatic way to compare enum values. You can use a `match` expression to achieve the desired comparison:

```rust
enum MyEnum {
    Foo,
    Bar
}

fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;

    let v = vec![MyEnum::Foo,MyEnum::Bar,MyEnum::Foo];
    for e in v {
        if let MyEnum::Foo = e { // The corrected line
            count += 1;
        }
    }

    assert_eq!(count, 2);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

The `if let` expression here is used to check if the variable `e` matches the `MyEnum::Foo` pattern. If it does, then it enters the `if` block and increments the `count`. This is the idiomatic way to compare enum variants in Rust.

## if let

For some cases, when matching enums, `match` is too heavy. We can use `if let` instead.
 6. ðŸŒŸ

**Question:**

In the provided Rust code, there is a `match` expression used to check if an `Option<i32>` named `o` is `Some`. If `o` is `Some(i)`, the program prints a long string and the value of `i`, and if not, it does nothing. How can we replace the `match` block with an `if let` statement?

```rust
fn main() {
    let o = Some(7);

    // Remove the whole `match` block, using `if let` instead 
    match o {
        Some(i) => {
            println!("This is a really long string and `{:?}`", i);

            println!("Success!");
        }
        _ => {}
    };
}
```

**Answer:**

The `if let` syntax in Rust provides a simpler and more concise way to do pattern matching if you're only interested in one variant of an enum. Here's how you could change the `match` block to an `if let` statement:

```rust
fn main() {
    let o = Some(7);

    // Using `if let` instead of `match`
    if let Some(i) = o {
        println!("This is a really long string and `{:?}`", i);
        println!("Success!");
    }
}
```

In this code, `if let` is used to match the `Some(i)` pattern. If `o` matches this pattern (i.e., if `o` is `Some(i)`), it executes the block of code that follows, printing the long string and the value of `i`, and then printing "Success!". If `o` is `None`, the `if let` statement does nothing, which matches the behavior of the original code.

**Question:**

The provided Rust code defines an enum `Foo` with a variant `Bar` that holds a `u8` value. In the `main` function, `a` is assigned to `Foo::Bar(1)`. The task is to fill in the blank with a code that matches `a` against `Foo::Bar` and prints the held value if it matches.

```rust
enum Foo {
    Bar(u8)
}

fn main() {
    let a = Foo::Bar(1);

    __ {
        println!("foobar holds the value: {}", i);

        println!("Success!");
    }
}
```

**Answer:**

We can use `if let` to match `a` against `Foo::Bar` and assign the held value to `i`:

```rust
enum Foo {
    Bar(u8)
}

fn main() {
    let a = Foo::Bar(1);

    if let Foo::Bar(i) = a {
        println!("foobar holds the value: {}", i);

        println!("Success!");
    }
}
```

In this code, `if let` is used to check if `a` matches the `Foo::Bar(i)` pattern. If it does, it assigns the value held in `Foo::Bar` to `i`, and then executes the code block that follows. This is how `if let` works in Rust, it allows you to match against patterns and conditionally run code based on which pattern matches, while ignoring others. This code prints "foobar holds the value: 1" followed by "Success!".

 8. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

**Question:**

The provided Rust code uses a series of `if let` statements to match against the variants of an enum `Foo`. If a variant matches, it executes a corresponding `println!` statement. The goal is to simplify this code by replacing the `if let` statements with a `match` expression. 

```rust
enum Foo {
    Bar,
    Baz,
    Qux(u32)
}

fn main() {
    let a = Foo::Qux(10);

    // Remove the codes below, using `match` instead 
    if let Foo::Bar = a {
        println!("match foo::bar")
    } else if let Foo::Baz = a {
        println!("match foo::baz")
    } else {
        println!("match others")
    }
}
```

**Answer:**

The `match` expression in Rust allows for concise control flow based on pattern matching, which is more readable and idiomatic when dealing with enums, like in this case. 

The code can be rewritten as follows:

```rust
enum Foo {
    Bar,
    Baz,
    Qux(u32)
}

fn main() {
    let a = Foo::Qux(10);

    // Using `match` instead of `if let`
    match a {
        Foo::Bar => println!("match foo::bar"),
        Foo::Baz => println!("match foo::baz"),
        _ => println!("match others")
    }
}
```

In this code, the `match` expression is used to check which variant `a` is. If `a` is `Foo::Bar`, it prints "match foo::bar". If `a` is `Foo::Baz`, it prints "match foo::baz". For any other variant (`Foo::Qux` in this case, but it could be any other variant as well), it prints "match others". This simplifies the original code and makes it more idiomatic Rust.

**Question:**

The provided Rust code attempts to define a variable `age` with `Some(30)` and then use pattern matching to destructure the `Option`. However, there's an error in the code where `age` in the `assert_eq!` call is expected to be an `i32`, but it is `Option<i32>`. The task is to correct this code in place:

```rust
fn main() {
    let age = Some(30);
    if let Some(age) = age { // Create a new variable with the same name as previous `age`
       assert_eq!(age, Some(30));
    } // The new variable `age` goes out of scope here
    
    match age {
        // Match can also introduce a new shadowed variable
        Some(age) =>  println!("age is a new variable, it's value is {}",age),
        _ => ()
    }
}
```

**Answer:**

The issue arises because we're trying to compare `age` (which is `i32` after the `if let` destructuring) with `Some(30)` which is `Option<i32>`. To fix the error, we should compare `age` with `30` directly in the `assert_eq!` call:

```rust
fn main() {
    let age = Some(30);
    if let Some(age) = age { // Create a new variable with the same name as previous `age`
       assert_eq!(age, 30);
    } // The new variable `age` goes out of scope here

    // We can redeclare `age` for the match expression to work
    let age = Some(30);
    
    match age {
        // Match can also introduce a new shadowed variable
        Some(age) =>  println!("age is a new variable, it's value is {}",age),
        _ => ()
    }
}
```

In this code, we first create an `Option<i32>` variable `age` with a value of `Some(30)`. In the `if let` statement, we pattern match `age` to `Some(age)` and shadow the original `age` variable, so within the `if let` block `age` now refers to the inner `i32` value, `30`. Then we use `assert_eq!` to verify that `age` is indeed `30`. After the `if let` block, the shadowed `age` variable goes out of scope, and `age` again refers to `Some(30)`. Finally, we use a `match` expression to pattern match `age` again and print its value if it is `Some(i32)`.
