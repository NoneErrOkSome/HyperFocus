1.ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Use | to match several values, use ..= to match an inclusive range.

**Question:**

The provided Rust function `match_number(n: i32)` takes an integer as input and matches it using a `match` statement. There is a requirement to match several values (from 2 through 5) in one of the arms of the match statement. We are supposed to fill in the blank with the pipe (`|`) operator to meet this requirement. The challenge does not allow the use of range (`..`) or inclusive range (`..=`) operators for this task.

```rust
fn match_number(n: i32) {
    match n {
        // Match a single value
        1 => println!("One!"),
        // Fill in the blank with `|`, DON'T use `..` or `..=`
        __ => println!("match 2 -> 5"),
        // Match an inclusive range
        6..=10 => {
            println!("match 6 -> 10")
        },
        _ => {
            println!("match -infinite -> 0 or 11 -> +infinite")
        }
    }
}
```

**Answer:**

In the `match` statement, we can match several specific values by using the `|` operator. This operator works like an OR operator between the values. For this task, we want to match any number between 2 and 5. Here's the corrected function:

```rust
fn match_number(n: i32) {
    match n {
        // Match a single value
        1 => println!("One!"),
        // Match multiple values using |
        2 | 3 | 4 | 5 => println!("match 2 -> 5"),
        // Match an inclusive range
        6..=10 => {
            println!("match 6 -> 10")
        },
        _ => {
            println!("match -infinite -> 0 or 11 -> +infinite")
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated code, the expression `2 | 3 | 4 | 5` will match if `n` is any of the values 2, 3, 4, or 5. The `|` operator in a `match` pattern works as a logical OR between the values it separates.

2. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ The `@` operator lets us create a variable that holds a value, at the same time we are testing that value to see whether it matches a pattern.

**Question:**

In the provided Rust code, a struct `Point` is defined with two fields: `x` and `y`. An instance of `Point` is being created, and its values are to be determined such that it matches the second arm of a `match` expression. The second arm of the `match` expression includes a pattern that matches `Point` instances where `x` is within the range of 0 to 5 (inclusive), and `y` is either 10, 20, or 30. The `@` operator is used in the pattern to bind the matched `y` value to a variable. The blanks in the instance creation need to be filled to meet these criteria.

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    // Fill in the blank to let p match the second arm
    let p = Point { x: __, y: __ };

    match p {
        Point { x, y: 0 } => println!("On the x axis at {}", x),
        // Second arm
        Point { x: 0..=5, y: y@ (10 | 20 | 30) } => println!("On the y axis at {}", y),
        Point { x, y } => println!("On neither axis: ({}, {})", x, y),
    }
}
```

**Answer:**

The `@` operator is being used in the pattern of the second arm of the `match` statement to both test and bind the value of `y`. It checks if `y` matches the pattern `(10 | 20 | 30)`, and if it does, the matched value is bound to the variable `y` for use within the match arm.

In order to make sure that `p` matches the second arm, `x` should be a value in the range `0..=5`, and `y` should be one of the values `10`, `20`, or `30`.

Here is how we can fill the blanks:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    // Fill in the blank to let p match the second arm
    let p = Point { x: 0, y: 10 };

    match p {
        Point { x, y: 0 } => println!("On the x axis at {}", x),
        // Second arm
        Point { x: 0..=5, y: y@ (10 | 20 | 30) } => println!("On the y axis at {}", y),
        Point { x, y } => println!("On neither axis: ({}, {})", x, y),
    }
}
```

In the updated code, we create a `Point` with `x` set to `0` and `y` set to `10`. This will match the second arm of the `match` statement since `x` is within the range `0..=5` and `y` equals `10`.

3. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

**Question:**

The provided Rust code defines an enum `Message` with one variant `Hello` that has an associated data `id`. An instance of `Message::Hello` is created with `id` as `5`. There is a `match` expression which tries to match the `Message::Hello` instance with various patterns based on the `id` value. However, there are errors in the code. The errors need to be fixed.

```rust
enum Message {
    Hello { id: i32 },
}

fn main() {
    let msg = Message::Hello { id: 5 };

    match msg {
        Message::Hello {
            id:  3..=7,
        } => println!("Found an id in range [3, 7]: {}", id),
        Message::Hello { id: newid@10 | 11 | 12 } => {
            println!("Found an id in another range [10, 12]: {}", newid)
        }
        Message::Hello { id } => println!("Found some other id: {}", id),
    }
}
```

**Answer:**

In Rust, the scope of variables bound in a match pattern doesn't extend to the entire `match` block. So, when you attempt to print `id` in the first match arm, it isn't in scope and you get an error. To fix this, you can use the `@` operator to create a variable binding within the pattern:

The second arm has a syntax error. The correct syntax for the pattern would be `id @ 10 | id @ 11 | id @ 12`.

Here is the corrected code:

```rust
enum Message {
    Hello { id: i32 },
}

fn main() {
    let msg = Message::Hello { id: 5 };

    match msg {
        Message::Hello {
            id: id @ 3..=7,
        } => println!("Found an id in range [3, 7]: {}", id),
        Message::Hello { id } if [10, 11, 12].contains(&id) => {
            println!("Found an id in another range [10, 12]: {}", id)
        }
        Message::Hello { id } => println!("Found some other id: {}", id),
    }
}
```

In this corrected code, the `@` operator is used in the first arm to bind the value of `id` to a new variable `id` if it matches the range `3..=7`. In the second arm, I use a conditional pattern (with `if`) to check if the `id` is within the range `[10, 12]`. Finally, the third arm matches any `id` that didn't match the previous patterns.

4. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ A match guard is an additional if condition specified after the pattern in a match arm that must also match, along with the pattern matching, for that arm to be chosen.

**Question:**

The given Rust code creates an `Option<i32>` variable `num` with a value `Some(4)`, and a `split` variable with a value `5`. Then there is a `match` expression that matches the `num` variable. The first arm of the `match` should assert that the value of `num` is less than `split`, and the second arm should assert that the value is greater than or equal to `split`. The keyword `split` must be used in the code. The challenge is to fill in the blank in the first arm of the `match` expression to make the code work.

```rust
fn main() {
    let num = Some(4);
    let split = 5;
    match num {
        Some(x) __ => assert!(x < split),
        Some(x) => assert!(x >= split),
        None => (),
    }

    println!("Success!");
}
```

**Answer:**

The key to this challenge is using a match guard. A match guard is an additional `if` condition specified after the pattern in a match arm that must also match, along with the pattern matching, for that arm to be chosen. Here, we can use a match guard to compare `x` with `split`.

```rust
fn main() {
    let num = Some(4);
    let split = 5;
    match num {
        Some(x) if x < split => assert!(x < split),
        Some(x) => assert!(x >= split),
        None => (),
    }

    println!("Success!");
}
```

In this solution, the `if x < split` is the match guard. If `num` is `Some(x)` and `x < split` is true, then this match arm will be chosen, and the assertion `assert!(x < split)` will pass. If `num` is `Some(x)` but `x < split` is false, then the second match arm will be chosen, and the assertion `assert!(x >= split)` will pass. If `num` is `None`, then the last match arm will be chosen, and nothing will happen.

5. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Ignoring remaining parts of the value with `..`

**Question:**

The given Rust code creates a tuple `numbers` with 11 integer values. The task is to fill in the blank in the `match` expression to bind the first and last elements of the tuple to the variables `first` and `last` respectively, ignoring all other elements of the tuple. The goal is to make the code work.

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048);

    match numbers {
        __ => {
           assert_eq!(first, 2);
           assert_eq!(last, 2048);
        }
    }

    println!("Success!");
}
```

**Answer:**

To achieve this, we need to make use of the `..` operator in Rust. This operator allows us to ignore parts of a value in a pattern. Specifically, in this case, we can use it to ignore all the elements of the tuple between the first and the last one.

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048);

    match numbers {
        (first, .., last) => {
           assert_eq!(first, 2);
           assert_eq!(last, 2048);
        }
    }

    println!("Success!");
}
```

In this solution, `(first, .., last)` is a pattern that matches a tuple. The `first` and `last` variables bind to the first and last elements of the tuple, respectively, while the `..` operator ignores all the elements in between. The code will run successfully if the first element of `numbers` is `2` and the last element is `2048`, which is the case.

6. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Using pattern `&mut V` to match a mutable reference requires you to be very careful, due to `V` being a value after matching.

**Question:**

The given Rust code tries to use the `match` keyword to match a mutable reference to a string and then append to that string. However, there's an error in the code, and the task is to fix this error with the least amount of changes possible. The code should not remove any existing lines.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut v = String::from("hello,");
    let r = &mut v;

    match r {
       &mut value => value.push_str(" world!") 
    }
}
```

**Answer:**

To fix the error in this code, we should remove the `&mut` from the match arm. The reason is that `r` is a mutable reference itself, so we don't need to re-borrow it in the `match` expression.

Here is the corrected code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut v = String::from("hello,");
    let r = &mut v;

    match r {
        value => value.push_str(" world!"),
    }
}
```

In this corrected code, `value` in the `match` expression now represents the mutable reference to the string "hello,", and thus `push_str` can be successfully used to modify the original string. The resulting string will be "hello, world!".
