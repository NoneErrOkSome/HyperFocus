7. ðŸŒŸ Use `break` to break the loop.

**Question:**

In the given Rust code, we are running a `for` loop that iterates from 0 to 100. We increment a counter `n` within this loop. The requirement is to stop this loop when `n` reaches 66 by using the `break` keyword. However, the keyword is missing from the code and needs to be filled in.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut n = 0;
    for i in 0..=100 {
       if n == 66 {
           __
       }
       n += 1;
    }

    assert_eq!(n, 66);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

**Answer:**

To break the loop when `n` reaches 66, we use the `break` keyword. The `break` statement in Rust is used to stop the execution of the enclosing loop immediately and transfer control to the next statement after the loop. This is how the code looks after filling in the blank:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut n = 0;
    for _i in 0..=100 {
       if n == 66 {
           break;
       }
       n += 1;
    }

    assert_eq!(n, 66);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

In the code above, the `for` loop runs from 0 to 100, and `n` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. When `n` becomes equal to 66, the `break` statement is executed which immediately exits the loop. Then, we assert that `n` is indeed 66. If this assertion is true, "Success!" gets printed to the console. If not, the program will panic at the `assert_eq!` line. This confirms that the `break` keyword is working as expected, and the loop is exited when `n` reaches 66.

8. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ `continue` will skip over the remaining code in current iteration and go to the next iteration.

**Question:**

In the given Rust code, we are running a `for` loop that iterates from 0 to 100. We increment a counter `n` within this loop. The requirement is to skip the remaining code in the current iteration and go to the next iteration when `n` is not 66 by using the `continue` keyword. Also, when `n` equals 66, we want to break the loop. The `continue` and `break` keywords are missing from the code and need to be filled in.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut n = 0;
    for i in 0..=100 {
       if n != 66 {
           n+=1;
           __;
       }
       
       __
    }

    assert_eq!(n, 66);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

**Answer:**

To skip the remaining code in the current iteration and go to the next iteration when `n` is not equal to 66, we use the `continue` keyword. To break the loop when `n` equals 66, we use the `break` keyword. Here is the code after filling in the blanks:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut n = 0;
    for _i in 0..=100 {
       if n != 66 {
           n += 1;
           continue;
       }
       
       break;
    }

    assert_eq!(n, 66);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

In the code above, the `for` loop runs from 0 to 100. If `n` is not equal to 66, `n` is incremented by 1 and the `continue` statement skips the remaining code in the current iteration, which in this case is the `break` statement, and moves to the next iteration of the loop. When `n` becomes 66, the `if` condition becomes false, so the `continue` statement is skipped and the `break` statement is executed, which exits the loop. Then, we assert that `n` is indeed 66. If this assertion is true, "Success!" gets printed to the console. If not, the program will panic at the `assert_eq!` line. This confirms that the `continue` and `break` keywords are working as expected.
