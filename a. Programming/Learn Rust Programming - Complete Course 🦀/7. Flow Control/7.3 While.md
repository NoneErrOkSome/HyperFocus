6. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ The `while` keyword can be used to run a loop when a condition is true.


**Question:**

In the provided Rust code, the aim is to run a loop using the `while` keyword and increment the counter variable `n` until a certain condition is met. The loop should implement the FizzBuzz game logic, printing "fizz" for numbers divisible by 3, "buzz" for numbers divisible by 5, and "fizzbuzz" for numbers divisible by both. Once `n` reaches a certain value, the loop should stop. However, some parts of the code are missing and need to be filled in to make the code work correctly.

```rust
fn main() {
    // A counter variable
    let mut n = 1;

    // Loop while the condition is true
    while n __ 10 {
        if n % 15 == 0 {
            println!("fizzbuzz");
        } else if n % 3 == 0 {
            println!("fizz");
        } else if n % 5 == 0 {
            println!("buzz");
        } else {
            println!("{}", n);
        }


        __;
    }

    println!("n reached {}, so loop is over",n);
}
```

**Answer:**

The provided code has two blanks that need to be filled.

1. `n __ 10`: Here, we want to continue the loop as long as `n` is less than or equal to 10. So, the correct operator to use is `<=`.

2. `__`: After each iteration of the loop, we need to increment `n` by 1. This can be done with `n += 1`.

The corrected code is as follows:

```rust
fn main() {
    // A counter variable
    let mut n = 1;

    // Loop while `n` is less than or equal to 10
    while n <= 10 {
        if n % 15 == 0 {
            println!("fizzbuzz");
        } else if n % 3 == 0 {
            println!("fizz");
        } else if n % 5 == 0 {
            println!("buzz");
        } else {
            println!("{}", n);
        }

        // Increment `n` by 1 after each iteration
        n += 1;
    }

    println!("n reached {}, so loop is over",n);
}
```

In the code above, the `while` loop runs as long as `n` is less than or equal to 10, printing the appropriate message for each value of `n`. After each iteration, `n` is incremented by 1. Once `n` is no longer less than or equal to 10, the loop stops, and the program prints a final message stating that the loop is over.
