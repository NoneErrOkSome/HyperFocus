3. ðŸŒŸ The `for in` construct can be used to iterate through an Iterator, e.g a range `a..b`.
   
   **Question:**

The given Rust program has a `for` loop which iterates over a range from 1 to 100 inclusive. Inside the loop, there's a condition to check if `n` is equal to 100. If `n` is equal to 100, the program will panic and terminate. The task is to modify the code to prevent this panic.

```rust
fn main() {
    for n in 1..=100 { // modify this line to make the code work
        if n == 100 {
            panic!("NEVER LET THIS RUN")
        }
    }

    println!("Success!");
}
```

**Answer:**

To prevent the panic, you need to modify the range of the `for` loop so that it does not include the value 100. You can do this by changing `1..=100` to `1..100`. Here, `1..100` will include 1 but exclude 100.

Here's how you can modify the program:

```rust
fn main() {
    for n in 1..100 { // Modified this line
        if n == 100 {
            panic!("NEVER LET THIS RUN")
        }
    }

    println!("Success!");
}
```

In Rust, the range syntax `a..b` includes `a` but excludes `b`, while the syntax `a..=b` includes both `a` and `b`. So by changing `1..=100` to `1..100`, the loop will iterate from 1 to 99 (inclusive), and the condition `n == 100` will never be true, thus preventing the program from panicking.

   **Question:**

The given Rust program has an array of `String` objects, and an array of integers. The program attempts to iterate over each array using a `for` loop, and then tries to print the arrays. However, it contains some errors that prevent it from compiling and running correctly. The task is to fix the errors without adding or removing lines.

```rust
fn main() {
    let names = [String::from("liming"),String::from("hanmeimei")];
    for name in names {
        // Do something with name...
    }

    println!("{:?}", names);

    let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
    // The elements in numbers are Copyï¼Œso there is no move here
    for n in numbers {
        // Do something with name...
    }
    
    println!("{:?}", numbers);
}
```

**Answer:**

The problem with the given code is the way it tries to iterate over the `names` array. When the `for` loop takes ownership of `names`, it moves each `String` out of the array, which means the array can't be used again. To fix this, we should use references in the `for` loop to borrow the `String`s rather than moving them.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```rust
fn main() {
    let names = [String::from("liming"),String::from("hanmeimei")];
    for name in &names { // Changed this line
        // Do something with name...
    }

    println!("{:?}", names);

    let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
    // The elements in numbers are Copy, so there is no move here
    for n in &numbers { // Added this line
        // Do something with name...
    }
    
    println!("{:?}", numbers);
}
```

The `&` operator is used to create a reference, which allows you to use a value without taking ownership of it. This is known as borrowing in Rust. By borrowing the values in the `names` and `numbers` arrays, we can still use the arrays after the `for` loop.

**Question:**

The given Rust program has an array `a` and the program attempts to iterate over the array, outputting both the index and value of each element in the array. The task is to fill in the blank to make this work correctly.

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [4, 3, 2, 1];

    // Iterate the indexing and value in 'a'
    for (i,v) in a.__ {
        println!("The {}th element is {}",i+1,v);
    }
}
```

**Answer:**

The `enumerate` method should be used to iterate over the indices and values in the array. This method transforms the iterator into another iterator that gives us a tuple where the first element is the index and the second is the value.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [4, 3, 2, 1];

    // Iterate the indexing and value in 'a'
    for (i,v) in a.iter().enumerate() {
        println!("The {}th element is {}",i+1,v);
    }
}
```
In the code above, `a.iter()` is called to get an iterator over the elements of the array, and then `enumerate()` is called to transform the iterator into an iterator of tuples, where the first element of the tuple is the index and the second is the value. The `for` loop then destructures these tuples into `i` and `v`, which are used inside the loop.
