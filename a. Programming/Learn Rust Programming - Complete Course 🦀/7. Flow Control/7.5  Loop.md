9. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Loop is usually used together with `break` or `continue`.

**Question:**

The provided Rust code defines an infinite loop using the `loop` keyword. A counter `count` is incremented within this loop. If `count` equals 3, the program should skip the rest of this iteration. If `count` equals 5, the program should break out of the loop. The keywords for skipping the rest of the iteration and breaking out of the loop are missing from the code and need to be filled in.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0u32;

    println!("Let's count until infinity!");

    // Infinite loop
    loop {
        count += 1;

        if count == 3 {
            println!("three");

            // Skip the rest of this iteration
            __;
        }

        println!("{}", count);

        if count == 5 {
            println!("OK, that's enough");

            __;
        }
    }

    assert_eq!(count, 5);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

**Answer:**

To skip the rest of the current iteration when `count` equals 3, we use the `continue` keyword. To break out of the loop when `count` equals 5, we use the `break` keyword. Here is the complete code after filling in the blanks:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0u32;

    println!("Let's count until infinity!");

    // Infinite loop
    loop {
        count += 1;

        if count == 3 {
            println!("three");

            // Skip the rest of this iteration
            continue;
        }

        println!("{}", count);

        if count == 5 {
            println!("OK, that's enough");

            // Break the loop
            break;
        }
    }

    assert_eq!(count, 5);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

In the above code, the `loop` keyword is used to create an infinite loop. If `count` equals 3, the program prints "three" and skips the rest of the current iteration with the `continue` statement. As a result, the statement `println!("{}", count);` is skipped when `count` equals 3. If `count` equals 5, the program prints "OK, that's enough" and breaks out of the loop using the `break` statement. Finally, the program asserts that `count` is indeed 5. If the assertion is true, "Success!" is printed to the console. If not, the program will panic at the `assert_eq!` line. This confirms that the `continue` and `break` keywords are functioning as expected.

10. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Loop is an expression, so we can use it with `break` to return a value

**Question:**

The provided Rust code defines a loop that increments a counter on each iteration. Once the counter reaches 10, the loop should break and return a value. This value is assigned to the variable `result`. The value to be returned when breaking the loop is missing from the code and needs to be filled in.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            __;
        }
    };

    assert_eq!(result, 20);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

**Answer:**

To return a value from a loop in Rust, we can use the `break` keyword followed by the value we want to return. Given the assertion `assert_eq!(result, 20);`, we know that the returned value should be 20. Here is the complete code after filling in the blank:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break 20;
        }
    };

    assert_eq!(result, 20);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

In the above code, a mutable `counter` is initialized with 0. A loop is then started which increments `counter` by 1 each time it runs. When `counter` reaches 10, the `break` statement is executed, causing the loop to end and return the value 20. This returned value is assigned to `result`. The `assert_eq!` macro checks if `result` is equal to 20. If it is, the assertion passes, and "Success!" is printed to the console. If not, the program will panic at the `assert_eq!` line, indicating that the loop did not correctly return the value 20 when `counter` reached 10.

11. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ It's possible to break or continue outer loops when dealing with nested loops. In these cases, the loops must be annotated with some 'label, and the label must be passed to the break/continue statement.

**Question:**

The provided Rust code includes nested loops annotated with labels. The labels are used in conjunction with `break` and `continue` statements to control the flow of the loops. The outer loop is annotated with the label `'outer`, and there are two inner loops, `'inner1` and `'inner2`. When the `count` variable reaches or exceeds certain values, the loops are either continued or broken with the respective labels. However, the final assertion check for the value of `count` is missing its expected value.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    'outer: loop {
        'inner1: loop {
            if count >= 20 {
                // This would break only the inner1 loop
                break 'inner1; // `break` is also works.
            }
            count += 2;
        }

        count += 5;

        'inner2: loop {
            if count >= 30 {
                // This breaks the outer loop
                break 'outer;
            }

            // This will continue the outer loop
            continue 'outer;
        }
    }

    assert!(count == __);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

**Answer:**

The expected value of `count` should be 30 when the outer loop breaks. This is because the first inner loop (`'inner1`) increments `count` by 2 until `count` is at least 20. After this loop breaks, 5 is added to `count` (making `count` 25), and then the second inner loop (`'inner2`) starts. The second inner loop will break the outer loop when `count` is at least 30. Because `count` is incremented in chunks (by 2 in the first inner loop, then by 5), and because the second inner loop neither increments `count` nor allows execution to go back to the first inner loop (it simply continues the outer loop), `count` will remain at 25 and will not reach 30. This is the final value that `count` should have when the program ends.

Here's the completed code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    'outer: loop {
        'inner1: loop {
            if count >= 20 {
                // This would break only the inner1 loop
                break 'inner1;
            }
            count += 2;
        }

        count += 5;

        'inner2: loop {
            if count >= 30 {
                // This breaks the outer loop
                break 'outer;
            }

            // This will continue the outer loop
            continue 'outer;
        }
    }

    assert!(count == 25);

    println!("Success!");
}
```

In this code, the `assert!` macro is used to check that the value of `count` is indeed 25 when the loops have completed. If the value of `count` is not 25, the `assert!` call will cause the program to panic. If `count` is 25, the assertion will pass, and "Success!" will be printed to the console.
