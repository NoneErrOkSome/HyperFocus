   **Question:**

We are given a partially complete Rust program. The program has a variable `n`, and the goal is to print a message that describes whether `n` is positive, negative, or zero. The `if` condition for checking if `n` is negative has already been provided, but the keywords for the other conditions are missing. The task is to fill in the blanks to complete the program. The blanks should be filled such that the program prints the correct message for variable `n`.

```rust
fn main() {
    let n = 5;

    if n < 0 {
        println!("{} is negative", n);
    } __ n > 0 {
        println!("{} is positive", n);
    } __ {
        println!("{} is zero", n);
    }
}
```

**Answer:**

To fill in the blanks, we'll need to use the `else if` and `else` keywords. The `else if` keyword is used to specify a new condition to test if the previous condition was false. The `else` keyword is used to specify a block of code to be executed if all conditions are false.

Here's how you can complete the program:

```rust
fn main() {
    let n = 5;

    if n < 0 {
        println!("{} is negative", n);
    } else if n > 0 {
        println!("{} is positive", n);
    } else {
        println!("{} is zero", n);
    }
}
```

In the given code:
- First, the program checks if `n` is less than 0, if true it prints that `n` is negative.
- If the first condition is false, it then checks if `n` is greater than 0, if true it prints that `n` is positive.
- If both the conditions are false, which means `n` is not less than 0 and `n` is not greater than 0 (thus `n` is 0), it prints that `n` is zero.

   **Question:**

In the provided Rust code, the aim is to evaluate a condition based on the value of `n` and perform different operations accordingly. However, the code contains errors that prevent it from functioning as expected. The task is to correct these errors.

```rust
fn main() {
    let n = 5;

    let big_n =
        if n < 10 && n > -10 {
            println!(", and is a small number, increase ten-fold");

            10 * n
        } else {
            println!(", and is a big number, halve the number");

            n / 2.0 ;
        }

    println!("{} -> {}", n, big_n);
}
```

**Answer:**

The main error in this code is that there's a mismatch of data types. `n` is an integer and the `big_n` is expected to be an integer, but the expression `n / 2.0` results in a floating-point number.

To fix this error, it's necessary to convert `n` to a floating-point number before the division, and then convert the result back to an integer. Additionally, the println statements inside the `if` statement should not start with a comma.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```rust
fn main() {
    let n = 5;

    let big_n = if n < 10 && n > -10 {
        println!("n is a small number, increase ten-fold");
        10 * n
    } else {
        println!("n is a big number, halve the number");
        // convert n to float for division, then back to int
        (n as f64 / 2.0).round() as i32
    };

    println!("{} -> {}", n, big_n);
}
```

In the code above, `(n as f64 / 2.0).round() as i32` is doing the required conversion operations. `n as f64` converts `n` from an integer to a floating-point number, then `/ 2.0` performs the division. The `round()` function is used to round the result to the nearest whole number, and `as i32` is used to convert the result back to an integer.
