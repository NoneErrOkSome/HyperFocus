Explain 15. Mapped Types as much details as possible, essentially. along side with TypeScript code.



Mapped types in TypeScript are a powerful feature that allows you to create new types by transforming existing ones. They provide a way to apply a transformation to each property of a type and generate a new type based on the results. This is particularly useful for creating variations of existing types without having to manually redefine them.

### Key Concepts of Mapped Types

1. **Syntax**:
   Mapped types use the `keyof` operator and square brackets `[]` to iterate over the keys of an existing type.

   ```typescript
   type MappedType<T> = {
       [P in keyof T]: NewType;
   };
   ```

   Here, `T` is an existing type, `P` represents each key in `T`, and `NewType` is the transformation applied to each property.

2. **Transformation**:
   You can apply different transformations such as making properties optional, readonly, or changing their types.

3. **Built-in Mapped Types**:
   TypeScript provides several built-in mapped types like `Partial`, `Readonly`, `Record`, etc., which are frequently used for common transformations.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Making All Properties Optional

You can create a mapped type that makes all properties of an object optional using the following syntax:

```typescript
type Partial<T> = {
    [P in keyof T]?: T[P];
};

interface User {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    email: string;
}

type OptionalUser = Partial<User>; // { id?: number; name?: string; email?: string; }
```

#### Example 2: Making All Properties Readonly

Similarly, you can make all properties readonly:

```typescript
type Readonly<T> = {
    readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P];
};

type ReadonlyUser = Readonly<User>; // { readonly id: number; readonly name: string; readonly email: string; }
```

#### Example 3: Mapping Property Values to Another Type

You can change the type of each property value:

```typescript
type Stringify<T> = {
    [P in keyof T]: string;
};

type StringifiedUser = Stringify<User>; // { id: string; name: string; email: string; }
```

#### Example 4: Creating Record Types

A Record maps keys to values, where both keys and values have specific types:

```typescript
type Record<K extends keyof any, T> = {
    [P in K]: T;
};

type PageViews = Record<'home' | 'about' | 'contact', number>; // { home: number; about: number; contact: number }
```

### Advanced Usage with Conditional Types

Mapped types can be combined with conditional types to create more complex transformations:

```typescript
type Nullable<T> = {
    [P in keyof T]: T[P] | null;
};

type NullableUser = Nullable<User>; // { id: number | null; name: string | null; email: string | null }
```

### Conclusion

Mapped types offer flexibility and power by allowing developers to transform and adapt existing types efficiently. They help reduce redundancy and improve maintainability by leveraging TypeScript's strong typing system. Whether you're making fields optional or converting property values into another form, mapped types provide a concise way to achieve these goals within your TypeScript codebase.
