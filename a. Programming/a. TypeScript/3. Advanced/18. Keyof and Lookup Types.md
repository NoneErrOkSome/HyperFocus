Explain 118. Keyof and Lookup Types as much details as possible, essentially, fudamentally. along side with TypeScript code.



In TypeScript, `keyof` and lookup types are powerful features that allow you to interact with the keys and properties of types, enabling more dynamic and flexible type definitions. Let's dive into each of these concepts in detail with examples.

### `keyof` Operator

The `keyof` operator is used to create a union type consisting of the keys of a given object type. This is particularly useful when you want to create types that depend on the keys of another type.

#### Example

Consider an interface `Person`:

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  location: string;
}
```

Using the `keyof` operator, we can create a new type that is a union of the keys of `Person`:

```typescript
type PersonKeys = keyof Person; // "name" | "age" | "location"
```

Here, `PersonKeys` becomes a union type `"name" | "age" | "location"`, representing all possible property names within the `Person` interface.

This can be useful in scenarios like creating utility functions that operate on object properties:

```typescript
function getProperty<T, K extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: K): T[K] {
  return obj[key];
}

const person: Person = { name: 'Alice', age: 30, location: 'Wonderland' };
const personName = getProperty(person, 'name'); // 'Alice'
```

In this function, `K extends keyof T` ensures that only valid keys for object `T` can be passed as the second argument, maintaining type safety.

### Lookup Types

Lookup types (also known as indexed access types) allow you to retrieve the type of a specific property within an object. This is done using bracket notation.

#### Example

Continuing with our previous example:

```typescript
type NameType = Person['name']; // string
type AgeType = Person['age'];   // number
```

Here, `NameType` will resolve to `string`, and `AgeType` will resolve to `number`, reflecting the types of those specific properties in the `Person` interface.

Lookup types can also be used dynamically in conjunction with other TypeScript features:

```typescript
function getValue<T, K extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: K): T[K] {
  return obj[key];
}

const age = getValue(person, 'age'); // number (30)
```

In this function example above, calling `getValue(person, 'age')` returns a value with the type inferred as `number`, which matches the expected output based on our defined interface structure.

### Combining Keyof and Lookup Types

You can combine both features for more advanced typing scenarios. For instance:

```typescript
function pluck<T, K extends keyof T>(objs: T[], key: K): Array<T[K]> {
  return objs.map(obj => obj[key]);
}

const people: Person[] = [
  { name: 'Alice', age: 30, location: 'Wonderland' },
  { name: 'Bob', age: 25, location: 'Builderland' },
];

const names = pluck(people, 'name'); // Array<string> -> ['Alice', 'Bob']
```

In this example:
- The function accepts an array of objects (`objs`) and a key (`key`) which must be one of the keys from those objects.
- It returns an array containing all values corresponding to that key from each object in the input array.
- The return type is dynamically determined as an array of whatever type corresponds to that specific property across all objects in input.

By leveraging these TypeScript features (`keyof`, lookup types), developers can write highly flexible yet strongly typed codebases that minimize runtime errors while maximizing compile-time safety and predictability.
