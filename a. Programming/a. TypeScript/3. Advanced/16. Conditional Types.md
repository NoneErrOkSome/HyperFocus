Explain 16. Conditional Types as much details as possible, essentially. along side with TypeScript code.



Conditional types in TypeScript are a powerful feature that allows you to create types that depend on a condition. They enable you to define types that change based on the input type, which can be particularly useful for creating flexible and reusable code. Conditional types are similar to conditional expressions in JavaScript or TypeScript, but they operate at the type level.

### Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of a conditional type is:

```typescript
T extends U ? X : Y
```

Here:
- `T` is the type you are checking.
- `U` is the type you are comparing against.
- `X` is the resulting type if `T` extends `U`.
- `Y` is the resulting type if `T` does not extend `U`.

### Example 1: Basic Conditional Type

Let's start with a simple example where we determine if a given type is a string:

```typescript
type IsString<T> = T extends string ? "Yes" : "No";

type A = IsString<string>;  // "Yes"
type B = IsString<number>;  // "No"
```

In this example, the `IsString` conditional type checks if `T` extends from `string`. If it does, it resolves to `"Yes"`, otherwise `"No"`.

### Example 2: Inferring Types

Conditional types can also infer types using the `infer` keyword. This allows capturing part of a type for use later in your condition:

```typescript
type GetReturnType<T> = T extends (...args: any[]) => infer R ? R : never;

function foo(x: number): string {
    return x.toString();
}

type ReturnTypeOfFoo = GetReturnType<typeof foo>;  // string
```

Here, we use a conditional type to extract the return type of a function. The `infer R` part captures what would be inferred as the return type if `T` is indeed a function.

### Example 3: Distributive Conditional Types

Conditional types distribute over union types by default. This means they apply individually to each member of the union:

```typescript
type ToArray<T> = T extends any ? T[] : never;

type StrArrayOrNumArray = ToArray<string | number>;  // string[] | number[]
```

In this case, when applying the conditional type to a union (`string | number`), it results in another union (`string[] | number[]`). Each member of the original union is processed separately.

### Example 4: Nested Conditional Types

You can also nest conditional types for more complex logic:

```typescript
type Flatten<T> = T extends any[] ? T[number] : T;

type A1 = Flatten<number[]>;   // number
type A2 = Flatten<string[][]>; // string[]
type A3 = Flatten<boolean>;    // boolean
```

Here, we define a conditional type called `Flatten`. It checks if the input type is an array; if so, it extracts its element type using indexing (`T[number]`). Otherwise, it just returns the original non-array type.

### Use Cases for Conditional Types

1. **Utility Types**: Many utility types in TypeScript's standard library (like ReturnType, InstanceType) use conditional types under the hood.
   
2. **Generic Programming**: They allow writing more generic and reusable code by enabling complex transformations on types.

3. **Library Development**: When building libraries or frameworks that need to work flexibly with various user-defined data structures.

4. **Advanced Type Inference**: Extracting specific parts of complex data structures based on certain conditions or patterns.

Conditional types enhance TypeScript's ability to provide detailed and accurate typings while maintaining flexibility and reusability in codebases. Understanding them can greatly improve your ability to write robust and scalable TypeScript applications.
