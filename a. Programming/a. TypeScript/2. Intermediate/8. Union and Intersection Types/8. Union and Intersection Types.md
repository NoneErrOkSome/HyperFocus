Explain Union and Intersection Types as much details as possible pls, along with typescript code.



Union and Intersection types are powerful features in TypeScript that allow developers to define types in a flexible and expressive way. These types enable the combination of multiple types into a single type, either by allowing values to be of multiple potential types (Union) or by requiring values to satisfy multiple type constraints simultaneously (Intersection).

### Union Types

A Union Type represents a value that can be one of several different types. It's like saying, "this variable can be of type A or type B." In TypeScript, you define a union type using the pipe (`|`) symbol between the possible types.

#### Example

```typescript
type StringOrNumber = string | number;

let value: StringOrNumber;

value = "Hello"; // valid
value = 42;      // valid
// value = true; // Error: Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string | number'.
```

In this example, `StringOrNumber` is a union type that allows `value` to be either a `string` or a `number`. Attempting to assign a value of any other type will result in a compile-time error.

#### Use Cases

- **Function Parameters**: You might want a function parameter that can accept multiple types.
  
  ```typescript
  function logValue(value: string | number) {
    console.log(value);
  }

  logValue("A string");
  logValue(100);
  // logValue(true); // Error: Argument of type 'boolean' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string | number'.
  ```

- **Return Types**: A function might return different types based on logic.
  
  ```typescript
  function getId(id: string | number): string {
    return `ID is ${id}`;
  }
  ```

### Intersection Types

An Intersection Type combines multiple types into one. It's like saying, "this variable must satisfy all these types simultaneously." In TypeScript, you define an intersection type using the ampersand (`&`) symbol.

#### Example

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
}

interface Employee {
  employeeId: number;
}

type EmployeePerson = Person & Employee;

let employeeDetail: EmployeePerson = {
  name: "John",
  employeeId: 1234
};

// let invalidEmployeeDetail: EmployeePerson = { 
//     name: "Jane" 
// }; // Error: Property 'employeeId' is missing in type '{ name: string; }' but required in type 'Employee'.
```

In this example, `EmployeePerson` is an intersection of `Person` and `Employee`, meaning any object of this type must have both properties defined.

#### Use Cases

- **Combining Interfaces**:

  This can be particularly useful when you want an object to conform to multiple interfaces.
  
- **Enhancing Functionality**:

   You may want an object with combined capabilities from different interfaces.
  
   ```typescript
   interface Drivable {
     drive(): void;
   }
   
   interface Flyable {
     fly(): void;
   }
   
   type FlyingCar = Drivable & Flyable;
   
   const myFlyingCar: FlyingCar = {
     drive() { console.log("Driving"); },
     fly() { console.log("Flying"); }
   };
   
   myFlyingCar.drive();
   myFlyingCar.fly();
   ```

### Conclusion

Union and Intersection Types provide flexibility in handling variables that may adhere to one or more specified structures. Union Types are useful for scenarios where data can logically exist as one among several potential forms, while Intersection Types are ideal for creating objects or parameters that need to fulfill multiple criteria simultaneously. Both concepts are integral parts of TypeScript's robust typing system, enhancing code safety and clarity.
