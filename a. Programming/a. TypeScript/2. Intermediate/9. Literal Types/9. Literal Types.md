Explain 9. Literal Types as much details as possible, essentially. along side with TypeScript code.



Literal types in TypeScript allow you to specify exact values a variable can have, rather than just the type of data. This feature is particularly useful for defining more precise types, enabling better type checking and reducing potential errors in your code.

### Types of Literal Types

1. **String Literal Types**
2. **Numeric Literal Types**
3. **Boolean Literal Types**

### 1. String Literal Types

String literal types allow a variable to be assigned one specific string value. These are useful for scenarios where a variable should only accept a limited set of specific string options.

```typescript
type Direction = 'North' | 'South' | 'East' | 'West';

let move: Direction;

move = 'North'; // Valid
move = 'South'; // Valid
move = 'Up';    // Error: Type '"Up"' is not assignable to type 'Direction'.
```

### 2. Numeric Literal Types

Numeric literal types restrict the values a number type variable can take.

```typescript
type DiceRoll = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6;

let roll: DiceRoll;

roll = 1; // Valid
roll = 6; // Valid
roll = 7; // Error: Type '7' is not assignable to type 'DiceRoll'.
```

### 3. Boolean Literal Types

Though less common, boolean literal types can be used to specify that a value must be either `true` or `false`.

```typescript
type IsActive = true;

let status: IsActive;

status = true;   // Valid
status = false;  // Error: Type 'false' is not assignable to type 'IsActive'.
```

### Combining with Union and Intersection Types

Literal types can be combined with union and intersection types for greater flexibility and specificity.

#### Union Type Example

Union types allow you to define a variable that could be one of several specified types or values.

```typescript
type YesNo = "yes" | "no";

function getAnswer(answer: YesNo): void {
    console.log(`You answered ${answer}.`);
}

getAnswer("yes"); // Valid
getAnswer("no");  // Valid
getAnswer("maybe"); // Error: Type '"maybe"' is not assignable to type 'YesNo'.
```

#### Intersection Type Example

Intersection types combine multiple types into one, allowing an object or function parameter to satisfy multiple constraints simultaneously.

```typescript
type ShapeType = { shape: string };
type ColorType = { color: string };

type ColoredShapeType = ShapeType & ColorType;

const square: ColoredShapeType = {
    shape: "square",
    color: "blue"
}; 

// Invalid example:
// const circle : ColoredShapeType= { shape:"circle" }; 
// Error because the object does not satisfy both ShapeType and ColorType.
```

### Using Literal Types with Enums

Although enums are a separate feature in TypeScript, they work well with literal types when you want more descriptive names for your values while maintaining strict typing.

```typescript
enum CardinalDirection {
    North,
    South,
    East,
    West,
}

function moveDirection(direction: CardinalDirection) {
    console.log(`Moving ${CardinalDirection[direction]}`);
}

moveDirection(CardinalDirection.North);   // Output: Moving North
moveDirection(CardinalDirection.South);   // Output: Moving South

// moveDirection(5); 
// Error because there is no matching enum member for the value.
```

### Conclusion

Literal types in TypeScript are powerful tools that enable developers to define stricter and more precise contracts within their code, reducing bugs and enhancing readability. They are especially useful when working with variables that have constrained sets of possible values, allowing you to leverage the compiler's capabilities for error checking at development time rather than runtime.
