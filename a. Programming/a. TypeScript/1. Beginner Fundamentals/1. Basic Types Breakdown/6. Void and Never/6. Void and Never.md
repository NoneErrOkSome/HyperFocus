Explain The any and unknown Types type as much details as possible pls, along with typescript code.

In TypeScript, `any` and `unknown` are two types that are used to denote variables whose types are not known at the time of writing the code. However, they serve different purposes and have different implications for type safety.

### `any` Type

The `any` type is a powerful but potentially dangerous feature in TypeScript. When a variable is declared with the `any` type, it effectively turns off type checking for that variable. This means you can assign any value to it and perform any operation on it without any compile-time checks.

#### Characteristics:
1. **Implicit Any**: If a variable is declared without an explicit type and cannot be inferred from its initializer, it defaults to `any`. However, using implicit `any` is generally discouraged unless you're migrating JavaScript code to TypeScript.
2. **Flexibility**: You can assign any value of any type to an `any` typed variable.
3. **No Type Safety**: Since there are no restrictions, using `any` can lead to runtime errors if not handled carefully.

#### Example:
```typescript
let someValue: any;

someValue = 5;
console.log(someValue.toFixed(2)); // Works fine because someValue is a number

someValue = "Hello";
console.log(someValue.toUpperCase()); // Works fine because someValue is a string

someValue = true;
console.log(someValue.toString()); // Works fine because someValue is a boolean
```

### `unknown` Type

The `unknown` type was introduced in TypeScript 3.0 as a safer alternative to `any`. While you can still assign any value to an `unknown` typed variable, you cannot perform operations on it without first asserting or narrowing its type.

#### Characteristics:
1. **Type Safety**: Unlike `any`, you can't directly use or manipulate an unknown value without first performing some kind of check or assertion.
2. **Explicit Assertions Required**: To use an unknown value safely, you need to either narrow its type via control flow (like using conditionals) or assert its type explicitly.
3. **Safer than Any**: Encourages developers to handle different types more carefully and prevents unintended operations.

#### Example:
```typescript
let uncertainValue: unknown;

uncertainValue = 10;

// Error: Object is of type 'unknown'.
// console.log(uncertainValue.toFixed(2));

// Narrowing down using a typeof check
if (typeof uncertainValue === "number") {
    console.log(uncertainValue.toFixed(2));
}

uncertainValue = "TypeScript";

// Using a type assertion
if (typeof uncertainValue === "string") {
    console.log((uncertainValue as string).toUpperCase());
}
```

### Conclusion

- Use the `any` type if you need maximum flexibility and are willing to give up on compile-time safety.
- Prefer the `unknown` type when dealing with values where the exact nature isn't known upfront but where maintaining safety checks at compile time is important.

By choosing between these two types appropriately based on your requirements, you can write more robust and maintainable TypeScript code while balancing flexibility with safety.
