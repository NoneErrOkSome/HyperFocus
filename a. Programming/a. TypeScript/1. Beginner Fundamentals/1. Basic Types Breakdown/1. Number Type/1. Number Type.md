Explain number type in typescript programming pls


In TypeScript, the `number` type is used to represent numerical values. It covers all kinds of numbers, including integers and floating-point numbers. TypeScript's `number` type is based on JavaScript's `number` type, which follows the IEEE 754 standard for representing double-precision 64-bit binary format numbers.

Here are some key points about the `number` type in TypeScript:

1. **Declaration and Initialization**:
   You can declare a variable with a number type using the `let`, `const`, or `var` keywords and initialize it with a numeric value. For example:
   ```typescript
   let integer: number = 42;
   let float: number = 3.14;
   ```

2. **Arithmetic Operations**:
   You can perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on number types.
   ```typescript
   let sum: number = 10 + 5; // Addition
   let difference: number = 10 - 5; // Subtraction
   let product: number = 10 * 5; // Multiplication
   let quotient: number = 10 / 5; // Division
   ```

3. **Special Numeric Values**:
   JavaScript (and thus TypeScript) supports special numeric values like `Infinity`, `-Infinity`, and `NaN` (Not-a-Number).
   ```typescript
   let infiniteValue: number = Infinity;
   let notANumberValue: number = NaN;
   ```

4. **Hexadecimal, Binary, Octal Literals**:
    You can represent numbers in hexadecimal (base-16), binary (base-2), or octal (base-8) formats.
    ```typescript
    let hexNumber: number = 0xFF; // Hexadecimal
    let binaryNumber: number = 0b1010; // Binary
    let octalNumber: number = 0o744; // Octal
    ```

5. **Template Strings for Complex Numbers**:
    When dealing with complex calculations or displaying numbers within strings, template strings can be handy.
    ```typescript
    const radius: number = 7;
    const area: string = `The area of the circle is ${Math.PI * radius * radius}`;
    ```

6. **Type Inference**:
    If you assign a numeric literal to a variable without specifying its type explicitly, TypeScript infers it as a `number`.
    ```typescript
    let inferredNumber = 123; // Inferred as type 'number'
    ```

7. **BigInt Support**:
     Although not exactly part of the standard `number` type, it's worth noting that TypeScript also supports the BigInt type for representing larger integers beyond the safe integer limit of regular numbers.
     ```typescript
     const bigIntNumber: bigint = BigInt(9007199254740991);
     ```

By using these features effectively in TypeScript, you can manage numerical data accurately and efficiently in your applications.
