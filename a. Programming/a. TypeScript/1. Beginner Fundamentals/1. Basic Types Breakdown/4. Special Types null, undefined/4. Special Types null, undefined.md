Explain Special Types null, undefined type as much details as possible pls, along with typescript code.



In TypeScript (and JavaScript), `null` and `undefined` are two special types that represent the absence of a value. They are fundamental to understanding how values and types work in TypeScript. Let's delve into each of these special types in detail.

### `undefined`

- **Definition**: In TypeScript, `undefined` is a type as well as a value that indicates the absence of a value or that something hasn’t been initialized.
- **Default Initialization**: Variables that are declared but not initialized explicitly are automatically assigned the value `undefined`.
- **Type**: The type `undefined` is its own primitive type and can be used in type annotations.

#### Example of `undefined`:

```typescript
let x: number;
console.log(x); // Output: undefined

function doSomething(y: number): void {
  console.log(y);
}

let result = doSomething(5); // Output: 5
console.log(result); // Output: undefined, because the function does not return anything
```

### `null`

- **Definition**: The value `null` represents the intentional absence of any object value. It’s often used to signify “no value” or “empty”.
- **Assignment**: Unlike `undefined`, variables are not automatically assigned to `null`. You must explicitly assign them.
- **Type**: Similar to `undefined`, there is a primitive type for `null`.

#### Example of `null`:

```typescript
let y: string | null = null;
console.log(y); // Output: null

y = "Hello, World!";
console.log(y); // Output: Hello, World!
```

### Comparison between `null` and `undefined`

1. **Equality vs. Identity**:
   - Using equality (`==`) comparison between them will return true because both represent an absence of value.
   - Using identity (`===`) comparison will return false because they are different types.

```typescript
console.log(null == undefined);  // true
console.log(null === undefined); // false
```

2. **Use Cases**:
   - Use `undefined` when you want to indicate that a variable has been declared but not yet given a value.
   - Use `null` when you want to indicate an intentional lack of any object value.

### TypeScript Strict Null Checks

With TypeScript's strict null checks enabled (by setting `"strictNullChecks": true` in your tsconfig.json), variables will not assume they can be either null or undefined unless explicitly specified in their types.

#### Example with strict null checks:

```typescript
// Enable strictNullChecks in tsconfig.json

let z1: number;       // Error if accessed without initialization under strict mode.
let z2: number | null;

// z1 = null;       // Error if strictNullChecks is enabled, cannot assign null to number.
// z1 = undefined;  // Error if strictNullChecks is enabled, cannot assign undefined to number.

z2 = null;           // This is allowed as we've specified that z2 can be either number or null.

// Function example with optional parameter which can be undefined
function greet(name?: string): string {
  return name ? "Hello, " + name : "Hello!";
}

console.log(greet());        // Output: Hello!
console.log(greet("Alice")); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

### Best Practices

- Prefer using one over the other consistently throughout your codebase based on what makes most sense semantically for your application.
- Utilize TypeScript's union types (e.g., `string | null`) for greater control over where and how these special values can appear in your code.
- Consider enabling strict mode for better error checking and more robust code.

By understanding these special types and leveraging TypeScript’s features like union types and strict checking, you can write more reliable and maintainable code.
