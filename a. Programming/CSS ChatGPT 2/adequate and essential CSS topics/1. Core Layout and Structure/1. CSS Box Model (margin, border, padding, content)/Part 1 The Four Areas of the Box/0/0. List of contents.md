For **Part 1: The Four Areas of the Box**, you need **4 sub-parts**, one for each area â€” each with its own behavior and role in layout:

---

### ðŸŸ¦ **Sub-Part 1: `content`**

- The actual area for text/images
    
- Width and height are applied here by default
    

---

### ðŸŸ¨ **Sub-Part 2: `padding`**

- Space **inside the box**, between `content` and `border`
    
- Pushes the content inward
    

---

### ðŸŸ¥ **Sub-Part 3: `border`**

- The visible edge around the `padding`
    
- Adds thickness around the box
    

---

### â¬œ **Sub-Part 4: `margin`**

- Space **outside the box**
    
- Creates distance between this box and other elements
    

---

Each of these can be individually styled, sized, and combined for custom spacing behavior. Want a visual or HTML+CSS sandbox example next?
