To solve the Contains Duplicate problem in Python, you will primarily need the following key syntax components:

1. **For Loops:** In Python, for loops are used for iterating over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string). The for loop runs a block of code for each item in the sequence.

    ```python
    for item in list:
        # block of code
    ```

2. **Set Data Structure:** The set data structure in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. It's useful for this problem because it allows you to check for the existence of an item in constant time.

    ```python
    my_set = set()
    my_set.add(item)  # add an item to the set
    item in my_set  # check if an item is in the set
    ```

3. **If Statements:** In Python, if statements are used to test for certain conditions and execute a block of code accordingly.

    ```python
    if condition:
        # block of code executed if condition is True
    ```

4. **Functions:** A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.

    ```python
    def function_name(parameters):
        # block of code
    ```

These components can be combined to solve the Contains Duplicate problem as follows:

```python
def contains_duplicate(array):
    # Create an empty set
    hash_set = set()

    # Loop through the array
    for i in array:
        # If an element is already in the hash_set, return True
        if i in hash_set:
            return True
        # If the element is not in the hash_set, add it
        else:
            hash_set.add(i)
    # If we've made it through the loop without finding a duplicate, return False
    return False
```
