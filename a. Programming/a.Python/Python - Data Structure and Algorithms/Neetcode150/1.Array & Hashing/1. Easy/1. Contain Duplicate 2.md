The "Contain Duplicate 2" problem typically builds upon the previous variations by introducing additional constraints or modifying the conditions under which we consider duplicates. Given the progression from "Contain Duplicate 0" to "Contain Duplicate 1," "Contain Duplicate 2" usually involves another layer of complexity.

### Potential Variation for "Contain Duplicate 2"

**Problem Statement:**
Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `k` and `t`, return `true` if there are two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array such that:
- The absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is at most `t`, and
- The absolute difference between `i` and `j` is at most `k`.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [1,5,9,1], k = 3, t = 3
Output: true
```

### Approach

This version combines constraints on both the value differences and index differences. To solve it efficiently:

1. **Use a Sliding Window with a Sorted Data Structure:**
   - Maintain a sliding window of size up to `k`.
   - Use a sorted data structure (like a balanced tree or sorted list) to keep track of elements within this window.
   - For each element, check if there exists an element within the window such that their difference is less than or equal to `t`.
   - If found, return true. Otherwise, slide the window forward by removing the oldest element outside the range of size `k`.

2. **Time Complexity:** O(n log k), where n is the length of the array. The insertion and deletion operations in a balanced tree or sorted list have logarithmic complexity.

Here’s how you might implement this approach using Python:

```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

def contains_nearby_almost_duplicate(nums, k, t):
    if k <= 0 or t < 0:
        return False
    
    sorted_list = SortedList()
    
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        # Ensure we only consider elements within range k
        if i > k:
            sorted_list.remove(nums[i - k - 1])
        
        # Check for any number in sorted_list within range [nums[i] - t, nums[i] + t]
        pos1 = SortedList.bisect_left(sorted_list, nums[i] - t)
        
        # Check if such number exists within bounds
        if pos1 < len(sorted_list) and abs(sorted_list[pos1] - nums[i]) <= t:
            return True
        
        # Add current number to sorted_list for future comparisons
        sorted_list.add(nums[i])
    
    return False
```

### Explanation:

- **SortedList:** This data structure allows us to maintain order while efficiently adding/removing elements.
- **Sliding Window:** By maintaining only up to 'k' elements in our sliding window (using a list), we ensure we're checking only relevant indices.
- **Binary Search:** We use binary search to find potential candidates that satisfy the condition based on value differences.

This solution effectively handles large arrays with these additional constraints while maintaining reasonable performance.

Pls explain step by step



Certainly! Let's break down the solution to the "Contain Duplicate 2" problem step by step:

### Problem Recap

You need to determine if there are two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that:
- The absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is at most `t`.
- The absolute difference between `i` and `j` is at most `k`.

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, we'll use a sliding window approach combined with a sorted data structure. Here's how it works:

#### Step 1: Initialize Data Structures

- **SortedList:** We'll use a data structure called `SortedList` from the Python library `sortedcontainers`. This allows us to maintain a dynamically sorted list of numbers, facilitating efficient insertion, deletion, and searching operations.
  
```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

def contains_nearby_almost_duplicate(nums, k, t):
    if k <= 0 or t < 0:
        return False
    
    sorted_list = SortedList()
```

#### Step 2: Iterate Over the Array

- **Loop Through Elements:** We'll iterate over each element in the array using an index `i`.

```python
for i in range(len(nums)):
```

#### Step 3: Maintain Sliding Window of Size k

- **Remove Elements Outside the Window:** If our current index exceeds `k`, we remove the oldest element from our sliding window. This ensures that our window only contains elements with indices within distance `k`.
  
```python
if i > k:
    sorted_list.remove(nums[i - k - 1])
```

#### Step 4: Check for Value Differences Within t

- **Binary Search for Candidate:** Use binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the position where an element greater than or equal to `(nums[i] - t)` can be inserted. This helps us find potential candidates whose value difference is within `t`.

```python
pos1 = SortedList.bisect_left(sorted_list, nums[i] - t)
```

- **Verify Condition:** Check if there exists an element in the sorted list at or after position `pos1` that satisfies the condition. Specifically, verify if its value is within range `[nums[i] - t, nums[i] + t]`.

```python
if pos1 < len(sorted_list) and abs(sorted_list[pos1] - nums[i]) <= t:
    return True
```

#### Step 5: Add Current Element to Sorted List

- **Update Sliding Window:** Add the current number to our sorted list for future comparisons.

```python
sorted_list.add(nums[i])
```

#### Conclusion

If we iterate through all elements without finding suitable indices that meet both conditions, we return `False`.

### Complete Code Example

Here’s how it all comes together:

```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

def contains_nearby_almost_duplicate(nums, k, t):
    if k <= 0 or t < 0:
        return False
    
    sorted_list = SortedList()
    
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        # Ensure we only consider elements within range k
        if i > k:
            sorted_list.remove(nums[i - k - 1])
        
        # Check for any number in sorted_list within range [nums[i] - t, nums[i] + t]
        pos1 = SortedList.bisect_left(sorted_list, nums[i] - t)
        
        # Check if such number exists within bounds
        if pos1 < len(sorted_list) and abs(sorted_list[pos1] - nums[i]) <= t:
            return True
        
        # Add current number to sorted_list for future comparisons
        sorted_list.add(nums[i])
    
    return False
```


### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n \log k)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array. This is because:
  - We iterate through each element in the array once, giving us a factor of \(O(n)\).
  - For each element, we perform operations on a `SortedList` that maintains at most \(k\) elements (the size of our sliding window). Operations like insertion, deletion, and finding positions using binary search take \(O(\log k)\) time.
  
### Space Complexity

- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \(O(k)\) because we maintain a `SortedList` that holds at most \(k\) elements at any point in time.

### Why This Approach Works

1. **Sliding Window Concept:** By maintaining a sliding window of size \(k\), we ensure that we only consider elements whose indices are within distance \(k\). This directly addresses one part of the problem's requirement.

2. **Sorted Structure for Efficient Range Queries:** Using a sorted data structure allows us to efficiently find if there exists any number within a specific range \([nums[i] - t, nums[i] + t]\). This addresses the second part of the problem's requirement regarding value differences.

3. **Efficient Updates:** The `SortedList` allows for efficient updates (insertions and deletions), making it possible to adjust our sliding window dynamically as we iterate through the list.

4. **Immediate Return on Success:** As soon as we find an index pair that satisfies both conditions, we can return `True` immediately, avoiding unnecessary computations.

### Additional Considerations

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If either \(k \leq 0\) or \(t < 0\), it's impossible to satisfy the conditions, so we return `False` immediately.
  - Handling duplicates inherently since we're checking for any value within range rather than exact matches only.

This solution effectively balances between simplicity and efficiency by leveraging appropriate data structures and algorithms to meet problem constraints optimally.
