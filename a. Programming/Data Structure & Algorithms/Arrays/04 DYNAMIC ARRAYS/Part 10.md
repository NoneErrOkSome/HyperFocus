### **Part 10: Mathematical Proof and Analysis of Amortized Complexity**

**Mathematical Proof of Amortized O(1) Time Complexity for Dynamic Arrays**

Amortized analysis involves understanding how the time complexity of a series of operations averages out over time. In the case of dynamic arrays, we use this analysis to show that, despite occasional costly resizing operations, the average cost per insertion remains O(1). 

### **Mathematical Breakdown of Resizing and Amortized Complexity**

1. **Geometric Series of Resizing Costs:**
   - Each time the dynamic array reaches its capacity, it doubles in size. This resizing operation requires copying all existing elements into the new, larger array.
   - To demonstrate this mathematically, let’s consider an initial capacity of 1 and analyze the sequence of operations as the array grows through repeated insertions.

2. **Cost Analysis of Each Resizing Event:**
   - **Initial Insertion**: No resize needed. Cost is O(1).
   - **First Resize**: When the second element is inserted, capacity doubles from 1 to 2. Cost: 1 copy.
   - **Second Resize**: When the fourth element is inserted, capacity doubles from 2 to 4. Cost: 2 copies.
   - **Third Resize**: When the eighth element is inserted, capacity doubles from 4 to 8. Cost: 4 copies.
   - **Nth Resize**: At each step, the cost of resizing is proportional to the capacity being doubled. If resizing occurs at capacity \( 2^k \), the cost is \( 2^{k-1} \).

3. **Summing the Total Cost of Resizing:**
   - The total cost of resizing up to a capacity \( N \) can be described as a sum of powers of 2:
     \[
     1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + \ldots + \frac{N}{2}
     \]
   - This sequence is a geometric series where each term doubles the previous one. The sum of this series is approximately \( 2N - 1 \). In Big O notation, this simplifies to O(N).

4. **Proof That Each Insertion Averages to O(1):**
   - While individual resizing costs are O(N), the total cost spread over all insertions yields an average (amortized) cost.
   - Suppose you perform \( N \) insertions. The resizing events cost a total of O(N), and the remaining insertions without resizing cost O(1) each. 
   - Thus, the average cost per insertion is:
     \[
     \text{Amortized Cost} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Number of Insertions}} = \frac{O(N)}{N} = O(1).
     \]

5. **Intuitive Explanation:**
   - The doubling strategy is key. By doubling the capacity, the frequency of resizing events decreases logarithmically relative to the number of insertions. Each time the array doubles, the number of insertions it can accommodate before resizing again doubles, exponentially spreading out the costly operations.
   - This balance ensures that even though resizing is an O(N) operation, it happens infrequently enough that the overall average cost of each insertion remains O(1).

### **Detailed Mathematical Analysis:**

1. **Defining the Total Cost Function:**
   - Let \( C(N) \) represent the total cost of inserting \( N \) elements, including all resizing costs.
   - The function can be expressed as:
     \[
     C(N) = N + (1 + 2 + 4 + \ldots + \frac{N}{2}) = N + (2N - 1) \approx 3N.
     \]
   - The first \( N \) accounts for the O(1) cost of each individual insertion, and the second term \( 2N - 1 \) accounts for the cumulative resizing costs.

2. **Calculating the Amortized Cost:**
   - The amortized cost per insertion is:
     \[
     \text{Amortized Cost} = \frac{C(N)}{N} = \frac{3N}{N} = 3 = O(1).
     \]
   - This confirms that, on average, each insertion takes constant time, as the O(N) resizing operations are spread across all insertions.

3. **Power Series Contribution Dominance:**
   - In a geometric series doubling like \( 1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots \), the last term dominates the series’ sum. Thus, the total cost is always closely approximated by the last term, which scales linearly with \( N \).
   - This characteristic ensures that the complexity does not escalate rapidly but remains manageable.

4. **Why Multiplicative Constants Don’t Matter in Big O:**
   - In Big O notation, constants are disregarded because they do not affect the function's growth rate. For example, \( 3N \) is simplified to O(N). Similarly, the doubling factor during resizing (whether it’s \( 2 \) times or \( 2.5 \) times) does not change the overall time complexity classification.

### **Illustrative Example in Go (Golang):**
- To visualize the impact of resizing and demonstrate the amortized complexity, here’s an example using Go that tracks the costs explicitly:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Simulate insertion and resizing with detailed cost tracking
func detailedAmortizedAnalysis() {
    mySlice := make([]int, 0, 1) // Start with a capacity of 1
    totalInsertions := 0         // Track the number of insertions
    totalCopyCost := 0           // Track the cumulative copying cost

    // Insert 16 elements to see multiple resizes
    for i := 0; i < 16; i++ {
        // Check if resizing is required
        if len(mySlice) == cap(mySlice) {
            resizeCost := len(mySlice) // Cost is the number of elements copied
            totalCopyCost += resizeCost
            fmt.Printf("Resizing: Capacity doubled to %d, Copy cost: %d\n", cap(mySlice)*2, resizeCost)
        }

        // Insert the element
        mySlice = append(mySlice, i)
        totalInsertions++
        fmt.Printf("Inserted %d: Length: %d, Capacity: %d\n", i, len(mySlice), cap(mySlice))
    }

    // Summary of total operations
    fmt.Printf("\nTotal Insertions: %d, Total Copy Cost: %d\n", totalInsertions, totalCopyCost)
    fmt.Printf("Amortized Cost per Insertion: %.2f\n", float64(totalInsertions+totalCopyCost)/float64(totalInsertions))
}

func main() {
    detailedAmortizedAnalysis()
}
```

### **Explanation of the Code Execution:**
- **Resizing Events and Costs**:
  - The slice starts with a capacity of 1 and doubles each time the capacity is reached.
  - Each resizing event tracks the number of elements copied, highlighting the O(N) nature of each resizing operation.
  
- **Final Analysis of Amortized Cost**:
  - The program outputs the total insertions, total copying costs, and calculates the average cost per insertion.
  - Despite the expensive resizing events, the amortized cost per insertion remains close to O(1), demonstrating the efficiency of the doubling strategy.

### **Conclusion of Part 10:**
- The mathematical proof and detailed analysis confirm that dynamic arrays achieve O(1) amortized time complexity for insertions. By spreading the cost of resizing across all operations, dynamic arrays maintain predictable and efficient performance, making them highly effective for handling dynamic data sizes in programming.
