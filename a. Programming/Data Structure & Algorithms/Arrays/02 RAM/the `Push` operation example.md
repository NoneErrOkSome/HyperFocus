In the `Push` operation example, there is no direct assignment to the struct fields because the `Push` method is manipulating the `elements` field of the `Stack` struct using the `append` function. Here's how it works in the context of Go:

### Explanation of `Push` Without Direct Field Assignment:

1. **Struct Definition**:
   ```go
   type Stack struct {
       elements []int // Field that holds the stack elements as a slice of integers
   }
   ```

2. **Push Method**:
   ```go
   func (s *Stack) Push(value int) {
       s.elements = append(s.elements, value)
   }
   ```

   - The `Push` method doesn’t directly assign a value to `elements` using something like `s.elements[index] = value`. Instead, it uses the `append` function, which dynamically adds the `value` to the slice `elements` inside the struct.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The `append` function internally handles the allocation and resizing of the slice, so it’s indirectly modifying the `elements` field.
   - This approach is common when dealing with slices because it simplifies adding elements without manually managing the size of the array.

### Full Example with Push Explained:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Stack represents a stack with integer elements
type Stack struct {
    elements []int // The slice that stores stack elements
}

// Push adds an element to the top of the stack
func (s *Stack) Push(value int) {
    // The append function handles the addition of the new element to the slice
    s.elements = append(s.elements, value)
}

func main() {
    // Create an instance of Stack and assign it to the variable stack
    stack := Stack{}

    // Use the variable to call the Push method
    stack.Push(10) // Internally appends 10 to elements
    stack.Push(20) // Internally appends 20 to elements
    stack.Push(30) // Internally appends 30 to elements

    fmt.Println("Stack after push operations:", stack.elements) // Output: [10 20 30]
}
```

### Summary:
- The `Push` method modifies the `elements` field indirectly by appending new values, rather than directly assigning to a specific index.
- This approach is typical in Go when working with slices, as it provides flexibility and simplicity in managing the underlying data without manually handling memory allocation or resizing issues.
