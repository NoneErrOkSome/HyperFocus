In the `Push` operation example, there is no direct assignment to the struct fields because the `Push` method is manipulating the `elements` field of the `Stack` struct using the `append` function. Here's how it works in the context of Go:

### Explanation of `Push` Without Direct Field Assignment:

1. **Struct Definition**:
   ```go
   type Stack struct {
       elements []int // Field that holds the stack elements as a slice of integers
   }
   ```

2. **Push Method**:
   ```go
   func (s *Stack) Push(value int) {
       s.elements = append(s.elements, value)
   }
   ```

   - The `Push` method doesn’t directly assign a value to `elements` using something like `s.elements[index] = value`. Instead, it uses the `append` function, which dynamically adds the `value` to the slice `elements` inside the struct.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The `append` function internally handles the allocation and resizing of the slice, so it’s indirectly modifying the `elements` field.
   - This approach is common when dealing with slices because it simplifies adding elements without manually managing the size of the array.

### Full Example with Push Explained:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Stack represents a stack with integer elements
type Stack struct {
    elements []int // The slice that stores stack elements
}

// Push adds an element to the top of the stack
func (s *Stack) Push(value int) {
    // The append function handles the addition of the new element to the slice
    s.elements = append(s.elements, value)
}

func main() {
    // Create an instance of Stack and assign it to the variable stack
    stack := Stack{}

    // Use the variable to call the Push method
    stack.Push(10) // Internally appends 10 to elements
    stack.Push(20) // Internally appends 20 to elements
    stack.Push(30) // Internally appends 30 to elements

    fmt.Println("Stack after push operations:", stack.elements) // Output: [10 20 30]
}
```

### Summary:
- The `Push` method modifies the `elements` field indirectly by appending new values, rather than directly assigning to a specific index.
- This approach is typical in Go when working with slices, as it provides flexibility and simplicity in managing the underlying data without manually handling memory allocation or resizing issues.

Yes, you understand it correctly. In Go, methods are tied to a struct, and you use them by first creating an instance of the struct (assigning it to a variable) and then calling the method through that variable. 

Here's a brief recap:

1. **Declare a struct**: Define a struct that represents your data.
2. **Define a method**: Attach a method to the struct using a receiver.
3. **Use the struct and method**: Create an instance of the struct, assign it to a variable, and then call the method using that variable.

### Example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Define a struct called Car
type Car struct {
    brand string
}

// Define a method tied to the Car struct
func (c *Car) Drive() {
    fmt.Println(c.brand, "is driving")
}

func main() {
    // Assign the struct to a variable
    myCar := Car{brand: "Toyota"}

    // Use the variable to call the method
    myCar.Drive() // Output: Toyota is driving
}
```

In this example:
- `Car` is a struct.
- `Drive()` is a method tied to the `Car` struct.
- `myCar` is an instance of the `Car` struct, and the method `Drive()` is called using `myCar`. 

You always use methods by calling them on instances of their respective structs.
