### 🧑‍🍳 Jada's Statement

> "There are **$1181\dfrac{1}{8}$** servings per pitcher, and we have **$5385\dfrac{3}{8}$** pitchers. What is the total number of servings?"

#### 🔑 Key Phrases

- “Servings per pitcher” ➜ rate
    
- “Total number of servings” ➜ asking for total amount
    
- “We have $5385\dfrac{3}{8}$ pitchers” ➜ a count of items
    

#### 🔁 Interpretation

This is a classic **rate × quantity** situation:

$$ \text{Total servings} = \text{Pitchers} \times \text{Servings per pitcher} $$

💡 So this is a **multiplication** scenario.

### 📅 Latanya's Statement

> "It takes $1181\dfrac{1}{8}$ days to serve all of the horchata. If there are $5385\dfrac{3}{8}$ pitchers total, what is the average number of pitchers served per day?"

#### 🔑 Key Phrases

- “Per day” ➜ this hints at division
    
- “Total pitchers” ➜ total amount being distributed
    
- “It takes $1181\dfrac{1}{8}$ days” ➜ time over which it is spread
    

#### 🔁 Interpretation

This is a **"total ÷ number of groups"** situation:

$$ \text{Pitchers per day} = \text{Total pitchers} \div \text{Days} $$

💡 So this is a **division** scenario.
