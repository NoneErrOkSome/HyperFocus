Okay, let's break down how to apply fraction division using the plain text LaTeX format you requested.

Understanding the calculation (like "keep, change, flip") is the first step. Understanding _when_ to use it often comes down to recognizing what the division represents.

Dividing by a fraction typically answers the question: **"How many groups of a certain fractional size fit into a total amount?"**

Think about regular division:

12 \div 3 = 4\$ asks: "How many groups of \$3\$ fit into \$12\$?" The answer is \$4\$ groups. Now apply this to fractions: * \$6 \div \frac{3}{4}\$ asks: "How many groups of size \$\frac{3}{4}\$ fit into \$6\$?" * \$\frac{1}{2} \div \frac{1}{6}\$ asks: "How many groups of size \$\frac{1}{6}\$ fit into \$\frac{1}{2}\$?" Here are some practical examples: **Example 1: Whole Number รท Fraction** * **Scenario:** You have \$6\$ cups of flour. A recipe requires \$\frac{3}{4}\$ of a cup of flour per batch. * **Question:** How many batches can you make? * **Applying Division:** You need to know how many times the required amount (\$\frac{3}{4}\$ cup) fits into the total amount you have (\$6\$ cups). This is a division problem: \$6 \div \frac{3}{4}\$. * **Calculation:** \$\$ 6 \div \frac{3}{4} = 6 \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{6 \times 4}{3} = \frac{24}{3} = 8 \$\$ * **Meaning:** You can make \$8\$ full batches. **Example 2: Fraction รท Fraction (Measuring)** * **Scenario:** You have a piece of ribbon that is \$\frac{7}{8}\$ of a meter long. You need to cut smaller pieces that are each \$\frac{1}{8}\$ of a meter long. * **Question:** How many small pieces can you cut? * **Applying Division:** You want to know how many times the small piece length (\$\frac{1}{8}\$ m) fits into the total length you have (\$\frac{7}{8}\$ m). This is \$\frac{7}{8} \div \frac{1}{8}\$. * **Calculation:** \$\$ \frac{7}{8} \div \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8} \times \frac{8}{1} = \frac{7 \times 8}{8 \times 1} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \$\$ * **Meaning:** You can cut \$7\$ pieces. **Example 3: Fraction รท Fraction (Serving Size)** * **Scenario:** You have \$\frac{1}{2}\$ a liter of juice. You want to pour servings that are \$\frac{1}{16}\$ of a liter each. * **Question:** How many servings can you pour? * **Applying Division:** Find out how many servings of size \$\frac{1}{16}\$ liter fit into the \$\frac{1}{2}\$ liter you have. This is \$\frac{1}{2} \div \frac{1}{16}\$. * **Calculation:** \$\$ \frac{1}{2} \div \frac{1}{16} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{16}{1} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \$\$ * **Meaning:** You can pour \$8\$ servings. **Example 4: Fraction รท Whole Number (Splitting a Fractional Amount)** * **Scenario:** You have \$\frac{3}{4}\$ of a pizza left. You want to share it equally between \$2\$ people. * **Question:** What fraction of the *whole original* pizza does each person get? * **Applying Division:** You are splitting the amount you have (\$\frac{3}{4}\$) into \$2\$ equal parts. This is \$\frac{3}{4} \div 2\$. * **Calculation:** \$\$ \frac{3}{4} \div 2 = \frac{3}{4} \div \frac{2}{1} = \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{8} \$\$ * **Meaning:** Each person gets \$\frac{3}{8}\$ of the whole pizza. **Key Takeaway:** When faced with a word problem or situation, ask yourself: **"Am I trying to figure out how many times a smaller amount (often a fraction) fits into a total amount?"** If yes, you likely need to divide the total amount by that smaller fractional amount. This relates directly to the diagram you shared earlier, which visualized \$5 \div \frac{4}{5}\$ as finding how many groups of \$\frac{4}{5}\$ fit into \$5\.
