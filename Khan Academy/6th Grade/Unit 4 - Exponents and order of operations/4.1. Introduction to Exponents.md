### Introduction to Exponents

Multiplication can be thought of as repeated addition. For example, multiplying 2 by 3 (2 × 3) means adding three 2’s together:

2+2+2=62 + 2 + 2 = 6

Now, instead of repeated addition, consider **repeated multiplication**. This leads us to the concept of **exponents**.

#### Understanding Exponents

Exponents allow us to write repeated multiplication more efficiently. For example:

232^3

This means **multiplying 2 by itself three times**, not 2 × 3. So:

23=2×2×2=82^3 = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8

#### More Examples:

1. **323^2 (3 squared)**
    
    - This means multiplying **two 3’s** together:
    
    3×3=93 × 3 = 9
2. **545^4 (5 to the fourth power)**
    
    - This means multiplying **four 5’s** together:
    
    5×5×5×55 × 5 × 5 × 5
    - First, calculate step by step:
        - 5×5=255 × 5 = 25
        - 25×5=12525 × 5 = 125
        - 125×5=625125 × 5 = 625
    - So, **54=6255^4 = 625**.

#### Key Takeaways:

- Exponents represent repeated multiplication.
- The base is the number being multiplied.
- The exponent tells us how many times to multiply the base by itself.
- **an=a×a×⋯×aa^n = a × a × \dots × a (n times)**

This notation is useful for simplifying calculations, especially for large numbers.
