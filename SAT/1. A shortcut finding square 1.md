Title: Shortcuts for Finding Squares Mentally

Starred Blocks:

Below are a few shortcuts (in plain-text style) to help quickly find squares mentally. These methods use simple LaTeX for clarity:

1. **Square of a Number Ending in 5**  
   If the number is $10a + 5$, then:
   $$
   (10a + 5)^2 = 100 \cdot a \cdot (a+1) + 25
   $$

   Example: $35^2$: Here $a=3$, so $3 \cdot 4 = 12$, then add 25 → $1225$.

2. **Using the Formula for $(n+a)^2$**

   The formula is:
   $$
   (n+a)^2 = n^2 + 2na + a^2
   $$

   If $n$ is easy to square (like $10$, $50$, or $100$) and $a$ is a small adjustment, this can be faster than direct multiplication.

3. **Difference of Squares**

   The formula is:
   $$
   n^2 - a^2 = (n-a)(n+a)
   $$

   Rearranged to find \( n^2 \):
   $$
   n^2 = a^2 + (n-a)(n+a)
   $$

   Example: To find \(51^2\) quickly, use 
   
$$
51^2 = 50^2 + (51 - 50)(51 + 50) = 2500 + 1 \cdot 101 = 2601.
$$

4. **Base 100 Trick (for numbers near 100)**  
   
If \( n = 100 + k \), then:
   
$$
n^2 = (100+k)^2 = 
100^2 + 
2\cdot100\cdot k +
k^2 =
10000 +
200k +
k^2
$$

Example: 
$$
102^2 =
10000 +
200 \cdot 
    2 +
    4 =
10404.
$$

Use whichever shortcut best fits the numbers you’re working with!
