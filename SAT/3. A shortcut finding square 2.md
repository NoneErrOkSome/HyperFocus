A very neat shortcut for squaring any number that ends in 1 is to use this formula:

  **N² = (N – 1) × (N + 1) + 1**

Here's why it works and how to use it:

### Why the Shortcut Works

Let N be a number ending in 1. Then you can write it as N = (10a + 1) for some integer a. Notice that:

- N – 1 = 10a
- N + 1 = 10a + 2

Multiplying these two gives:   (10a) × (10a + 2) = 100a² + 20a

Then, adding 1 results in:   100a² + 20a + 1  
which is exactly the expansion of (10a + 1)².

In other words:   (N – 1) × (N + 1) + 1 = N²

### How to Use It: Step-by-Step

1. **Subtract 1 from the number.**  
      For example, if N = 31, then N – 1 = 30.
    
2. **Add 1 to the number.**  
      For N = 31, then N + 1 = 32.
    
3. **Multiply the results of step 1 and 2.**  
      For 31: 30 × 32 = 960.
    
4. **Add 1 to the product from step 3.**  
      960 + 1 = 961, so 31² = 961.
    

### More Examples

- **11²:**  
      (11 – 1) × (11 + 1) + 1 = 10 × 12 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121
    
- **21²:**  
      (21 – 1) × (21 + 1) + 1 = 20 × 22 + 1 = 440 + 1 = 441
    
- **41²:**  
      (41 – 1) × (41 + 1) + 1 = 40 × 42 + 1 = 1680 + 1 = 1681
    
- **91²:**  
      (91 – 1) × (91 + 1) + 1 = 90 × 92 + 1 = 8280 + 1 = 8281
    

### Conclusion

This shortcut is especially handy because the multiplication in the middle often involves round numbers (multiples of 10), making the arithmetic simpler. Next time you need to square a number ending in 1, just remember:

  **Square = (Number – 1) × (Number + 1) + 1**

This gives you a quick mental math tool for these specific cases.
