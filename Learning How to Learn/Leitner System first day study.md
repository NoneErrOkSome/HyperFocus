To study a **first set of flashcards** using **spaced repetition** within the **first day**, you’ll follow a structured process to maximize your learning and retention. Here’s how to do it:

---

### **Step-by-Step Guide for Day 1 with Spaced Repetition**

#### **1. Break Flashcards into Manageable Groups**

- Divide your flashcards into smaller batches (e.g., 10–20 cards per group).
    - This prevents overwhelm and ensures focus.
    - Example: If you have 50 flashcards, break them into 5 groups of 10 cards.

---

#### **2. First Review (Learn the Cards)**

- Start with **Batch 1**:
    
    - Read the **front** of the card (question/prompt) and try to recall the **back** (answer).
    - If you:
        - **Get it right**: Mark it as “correct” and move to the next card.
        - **Get it wrong**: Mark it as “incorrect” and put it aside for extra review.
- Repeat this process for the entire batch.
    

---

#### **3. Immediate Review (Active Recall)**

- Test yourself **immediately after completing the first review**:
    - Shuffle the cards and go through them again.
    - Focus on the **incorrect cards first**, testing them until you get them right.

---

#### **4. Spaced Intervals Within the Day**

Use shorter intervals for the first day to reinforce memory. Here’s an example schedule for **Day 1**:

|**Interval**|**Action**|
|---|---|
|**0 min**|Learn cards for the first time (Batch 1).|
|**10 min**|Review the same batch (focus on mistakes).|
|**30 min**|Test yourself again on the batch.|
|**2 hours**|Test the batch again (include new mistakes).|
|**End of Day**|Final review of the batch before sleeping.|

---

#### **5. Add More Batches Gradually**

- Once you’re comfortable with Batch 1, move to Batch 2.
- Use the same review intervals (e.g., 0 min, 10 min, 30 min, 2 hours).
- At the **end of the day**, review all batches together.

---

#### **6. Adjust for Forgotten Cards**

- Cards you consistently get wrong:
    
    - Repeat them more frequently.
    - Consider resetting them to the **start of the cycle** for Day 1.
- Cards you recall easily:
    
    - Move them to **less frequent reviews** (e.g., review on Day 3 instead of Day 2).

---

### **Tips for Day 1**

1. **Prioritize Understanding**:
    
    - For cards you repeatedly forget, focus on **understanding** the concept rather than just memorizing.
2. **Active Recall**:
    
    - Always try to recall the answer before flipping the card.
3. **Stay Consistent**:
    
    - Stick to your planned intervals even if it feels repetitive. Spacing the reviews improves retention.

---

### **Example for 10 Flashcards**

1. **First Review (0 min)**:
    - Go through all 10 cards, marking correct and incorrect answers.
2. **Immediate Recall (10 min)**:
    - Test yourself on all cards again, focusing on incorrect ones.
3. **Second Interval (30 min)**:
    - Shuffle the cards and test yourself again.
4. **Longer Interval (2 hours)**:
    - Review all 10 cards one more time.
5. **Final Review (End of Day)**:
    - Go through all cards for the last time before sleeping.

By the end of Day 1, you’ll have reinforced your memory through active recall and spaced intervals. On subsequent days, continue increasing the intervals (e.g., 1 day, 2 days, 4 days). Let me know if you need help planning beyond Day 1!
