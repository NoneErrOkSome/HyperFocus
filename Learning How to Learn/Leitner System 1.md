To ensure this system works smoothly across months with varying lengths (28, 30, or 31 days), we can anchor the **days of the week** to specific dates while maintaining the **cycle logic** intact. This way, the schedule adapts to any month and avoids confusion.

### **Revised 8-Slot Leitner System with Anchored Dates**

#### **How It Works**

- Use the **days of the week** for review patterns (e.g., Monday, Friday).
- Anchor those days to **specific dates** within the month, ensuring the schedule adjusts smoothly regardless of month length.
- Reset the schedule at the **start of each month**.

### **Revised Table**

|**Slot**|**Frequency**|**Days of the Week**|**Anchored Dates**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Slot 1**|Daily|Every day|**1, 2, 3...28, 29, 30, 31** (all days of the month)|
|**Slot 2**|Every 2 days|Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday|**2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12...30**|
|**Slot 3**|Every 4 days|Monday, Friday|**3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31**|
|**Slot 4**|Every 6 days|Wednesday, Sunday|**5, 11, 17, 23, 29**|
|**Slot 5**|Weekly|Friday|**7, 14, 21, 28**|
|**Slot 6**|Weekly (Advanced Cycle)|Saturday|**8, 15, 22, 29**|
|**Slot 7**|Biweekly|Alternate Fridays|**7, 21**|
|**Slot 8**|Monthly (Mastery)|First Sunday of the Month|**1st Sunday only (adjust by month)**|

### **How Dates and Days Align**

1. **Slot 1 (Daily)**:
    
    - Covers **all dates in the month** (1â€“30 or 31).
    - Example: Review new/difficult cards every day.
2. **Slot 2 (Every 2 Days)**:
    
    - Anchored to **Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays** and their nearest dates:
        - Example for February (28 days): **2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28**.
        - Example for March (31 days): Add **30**.
3. **Slot 3 (Every 4 Days)**:
    
    - Anchored to **Mondays, Fridays**:
        - Example: **3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31**.
4. **Slot 4 (Every 6 Days)**:
    
    - Anchored to **Wednesdays, Sundays**:
        - Example: **5, 11, 17, 23, 29** (if fewer days, stop earlier).
5. **Slot 5 (Weekly)**:
    
    - Anchored to **Fridays**:
        - Example: **7, 14, 21, 28**.
6. **Slot 6 (Weekly Advanced)**:
    
    - Anchored to **Saturdays**:
        - Example: **8, 15, 22, 29**.
7. **Slot 7 (Biweekly)**:
    
    - Anchored to **Alternate Fridays**:
        - Example: **7, 21**.
8. **Slot 8 (Monthly Mastery)**:
    
    - Anchored to **1st Sunday of Each Month**:
        - Example: February 4th, March 3rd, April 7th, etc.

### **How to Reset Each Month**

1. **Start Fresh Each Month**:
    
    - On the 1st day of the new month, adjust reviews to match anchored dates.
    - If a day overlaps (e.g., 31st in January followed by February 1st), continue seamlessly.
2. **Handle Missing Dates**:
    
    - For months with fewer days (28 or 30):
        - Skip missing dates (e.g., February won't include Slot 3 on the 31st).
        - Continue from the next available day.
3. **Adjust for Monthly Review (Slot 8)**:
    
    - Set the **1st Sunday** as the anchor.
    - If the 1st Sunday is the 5th, review Slot 8 on that date.

### **Example Workflow (February with 28 Days)**

|**Day**|**Slots to Review**|
|---|---|
|**1 (Wed)**|Slot 1|
|**2 (Thu)**|Slot 1, Slot 2|
|**3 (Fri)**|Slot 1, Slot 3, Slot 5|
|**4 (Sat)**|Slot 1, Slot 2, Slot 6|
|**5 (Sun)**|Slot 1, Slot 4|
|**6 (Mon)**|Slot 1|
|**7 (Tue)**|Slot 1, Slot 2, Slot 3|
|**8 (Wed)**|Slot 1, Slot 2, Slot 6|
|**11 (Sat)**|Slot 1, Slot 4|

---

### **Why This Works**

- **Predictable Anchoring**: Dates align with days of the week and adjust for month length.
- **Consistent Flow**: Ensures no gaps in review due to shorter months.
- **Simple Resets**: The start of each month provides a natural checkpoint.
