Here is a Go code example demonstrating **nested loops** and **debugging with breakpoints** based on the previous explanation.

### Folder Structure:
```
myapp/
    ├── main.go
    ├── go.mod
```

### `main.go` (Root Folder)
This program includes an outer loop and an inner loop, demonstrating how nested loops work. You can also use this code with the **Delve** debugger to set breakpoints and step through the code.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// Outer loop: Runs 10 times
	for i := 1; i <= 10; i++ {
		// Print the value of i in the outer loop
		fmt.Print("i is ", i, " ")

		// Inner loop: Runs 3 times for every iteration of the outer loop
		for j := 1; j <= 3; j++ {
			// Print the value of j in the inner loop
			fmt.Print(j, ": ", j, " ")
		}

		// Print a newline after the inner loop completes
		fmt.Println()
	}
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Outer Loop**: 
   - The outer loop runs 10 times (`i` goes from 1 to 10).
   - Each time it runs, it prints the current value of `i` and then triggers the inner loop.

2. **Inner Loop**:
   - The inner loop runs 3 times for each iteration of the outer loop (`j` goes from 1 to 3).
   - It prints the current value of `j` and outputs it alongside `i`.

3. **Newline After Inner Loop**:
   - After the inner loop finishes, a `fmt.Println()` adds a newline to separate the outputs for each iteration of the outer loop.

### Debugging with Delve:

1. **Setting Breakpoints**:
   - You can set a **breakpoint** on any line (e.g., on the first line of the outer loop) to pause execution and inspect the values of variables like `i` and `j`.

2. **Stepping Through Code**:
   - Once the debugger pauses at a breakpoint, you can **step through** each line of code, watching how `i` and `j` change at each step of the loop.

### Example of Using Delve:

To use Delve to debug this code, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize Go Mod**:
   In the terminal, type:
   ```bash
   go mod init myapp
   ```

2. **Install Delve (if not installed)**:
   Install Delve by running:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@latest
   ```

3. **Run the Debugger**:
   In Visual Studio Code or in the terminal, you can run the debugger by typing:
   ```bash
   dlv debug
   ```

4. **Set Breakpoints**:
   - Set a breakpoint on the `for` loop (e.g., on the first line of the outer loop or inside the inner loop).
   - Start stepping through the code using `dlv` to observe how `i` and `j` are updated in real time.

### Example Output:

When running the program without debugging, the output will look like this:

```
i is 1 1: 1 2: 2 3: 3 
i is 2 1: 1 2: 2 3: 3 
i is 3 1: 1 2: 2 3: 3 
i is 4 1: 1 2: 2 3: 3 
i is 5 1: 1 2: 2 3: 3 
i is 6 1: 1 2: 2 3: 3 
i is 7 1: 1 2: 2 3: 3 
i is 8 1: 1 2: 2 3: 3 
i is 9 1: 1 2: 2 3: 3 
i is 10 1: 1 2: 2 3: 3 
```

### What You'll Observe in Debugger:
- **Outer Loop**: When you step through the code, you will observe the value of `i` incrementing from 1 to 10. Each time the outer loop completes an iteration, the inner loop starts again.
- **Inner Loop**: For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs 3 times, with the value of `j` going from 1 to 3.
- **Loop Interaction**: By using breakpoints and stepping through the code, you can see how `i` remains constant while the inner loop iterates through the values of `j`.

### Summary of What You've Learned:

1. **Nested Loops**: 
   - The outer loop runs multiple iterations, and for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs multiple times.
   - This structure is useful when processing multi-dimensional data (e.g., matrices, grids) or repeating tasks within tasks.

2. **Delve Debugger**: 
   - You can set breakpoints and step through the code to inspect variables in real time.
   - The debugger allows you to watch how the values of `i` and `j` change during each iteration of the loops.

This code demonstrates **nested loops** in Go, and using the **Delve** debugger, you can gain insights into how your program is executing step-by-step.
