The delay and incorrect response you're observing are likely caused by how the `keyboard.GetSingleKey()` function captures key inputs. This function reads the key press event, but it can also capture non-visible keys (like spaces or newlines) as separate input events. If the key buffer has unprocessed inputs, it can cause unexpected behavior, where the program reacts to previous key presses rather than the current one.

### **Explanation of the Issue:**
- **Input Buffering**: The `keyboard.GetSingleKey()` function reads one key at a time, including special keys like spaces, Enter, or even the delay between presses. If you press a number followed by a space, the space is captured as a separate event and processed later.
- **Delayed Input Handling**: Each time you press a key, it is added to a queue. If multiple keys are pressed quickly, the program might still be processing the previous keys in the queue, leading to unexpected outputs.

### **Solution: Clear Input Buffers and Handle Special Keys**
To fix this issue, you can:
1. **Clear the buffer immediately after reading each input** to prevent leftover keys from being processed.
2. **Filter out non-relevant keys** (like spaces, Enter, etc.) to ensure only the desired numeric inputs or quit commands are processed.

Hereâ€™s an updated version of the code with improvements to handle these issues:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"strconv"

	"github.com/eiannone/keyboard"
)

func main() {
	// Open the keyboard for input
	err := keyboard.Open()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer func() {
		_ = keyboard.Close()
	}()

	// Display the menu
	fmt.Println("MENU")
	fmt.Println("----")
	fmt.Println("1 - Capuccino")
	fmt.Println("2 - Latte")
	fmt.Println("3 - Americano")
	fmt.Println("4 - Mocha")
	fmt.Println("5 - Macchiato")
	fmt.Println("6 - Espresso")
	fmt.Println("Q - Quit the program")

	// Define the coffee options map
	coffee := map[int]string{
		1: "Capuccino",
		2: "Latte",
		3: "Americano",
		4: "Mocha",
		5: "Macchiato",
		6: "Espresso",
	}

	// Loop to capture user input
	for {
		// Read a single key from the keyboard
		char, key, err := keyboard.GetSingleKey()
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}

		// Quit if 'Q' or 'q' is pressed
		if char == 'q' || char == 'Q' {
			break
		}

		// Ignore non-visible or special keys (like spaces, enter, etc.)
		if key != 0 {
			continue
		}

		// Convert the char to an integer if it is a number
		i, err := strconv.Atoi(string(char))
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println("Invalid input, please enter a number between 1 and 6, or 'Q' to quit.")
			continue
		}

		// Check if the input number is within the coffee map range
		if coffeeName, exists := coffee[i]; exists {
			fmt.Printf("You chose %s\n", coffeeName)
		} else {
			fmt.Println("Invalid selection, please choose a valid number between 1 and 6.")
		}
	}

	fmt.Println("Program exiting...")
}
```

### **Key Changes Explained:**
1. **Ignore Non-Visible Keys**: The line `if key != 0 { continue }` ensures that the program only processes visible characters and ignores non-visible key presses (like spaces, Enter, etc.).
   
2. **Immediate Buffer Handling**: By filtering special keys and only processing valid input, the program ensures it responds accurately to each key press without delays or misreads.

This approach should fix the delayed input response and ensure that the program correctly reads and processes each key press as intended. Let me know if you need any more clarifications or further adjustments!
