Here's a line-by-line explanation of your Go code:

```go
package main
```
- This line declares the package name as `main`. The `main` package is the starting point of a Go program, and it must include a `main()` function, which serves as the entry point for the program.

```go
import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strings"
)
```
- These lines import necessary packages:
  - `bufio`: Provides buffered I/O operations, allowing efficient reading and writing, particularly for input from the console.
  - `fmt`: Implements formatted I/O, similar to Câ€™s printf and scanf, and is used for printing messages to the console.
  - `os`: Provides a platform-independent interface to operating system functionality, including reading input/output streams.
  - `strings`: Contains functions to manipulate strings, such as replacing, trimming, and splitting.

```go
reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
```
- This line creates a new buffered reader named `reader` that reads from `os.Stdin` (the standard input stream, which is typically the console). This allows reading input from the user efficiently, handling large inputs if necessary.

```go
fmt.Println("What is your name:?")
fmt.Print("-> ")
```
- `fmt.Println("What is your name:?")` prints the prompt "What is your name:?" followed by a newline to the console.
- `fmt.Print("-> ")` prints a prompt arrow (`-> `) without adding a newline, indicating where the user should type their input.

```go
userInput, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')
```
- This line reads a line of text from the user until the newline character (`'\n'`) is encountered. The `ReadString` function returns two values: the string input (`userInput`) and an error (which is ignored here using `_`).
- `userInput` will include the newline character at the end, which needs to be removed before further processing.

```go
userInput = strings.Replace(userInput, "\r\n", "", -1)
userInput = strings.Replace(userInput, "\n", "", -1)
```
- These lines remove newline characters from the input string. 
  - `strings.Replace(userInput, "\r\n", "", -1)` removes the Windows-style newline (`\r\n`) which can occur when the code is run on Windows.
  - `strings.Replace(userInput, "\n", "", -1)` removes Unix-style newlines (`\n`) used in other operating systems.
  - The `-1` argument specifies that all occurrences of the newline characters should be replaced, not just the first one.

```go
fmt.Println("Your name is", userInput)
```
- This line prints the cleaned-up user input, displaying: "Your name is [user input]". It shows the entered name without any trailing newline characters.

### **Summary**
The program prompts the user to enter their name, reads the input, removes any newline characters from the input string, and then displays the cleaned input back to the user with a message.
