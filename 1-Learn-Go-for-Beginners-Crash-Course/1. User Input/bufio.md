`bufio` stands for **buffered I/O**, which is short for **buffered input/output**. The `bufio` package in Go provides an efficient way to read and write data using buffers. Instead of reading or writing data one byte at a time, which can be slow, `bufio` allows data to be read and written in chunks (buffers), which improves performance, especially for larger data.

For example, `bufio.NewReader` reads input in chunks, making it more efficient than reading individual characters or bytes from `os.Stdin` one at a time.

---
In Go, you can use `bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)` to create a reader that reads input from the terminal (standard input). This line sets up the reader to capture user input interactively.

Example:
```go
reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
```

Alternatively, you could name the variable anything you'd like, such as `readInput`, like this:
```go
readInput := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
```
Both are correct and function the same way. The difference is just the variable name.

The `ReadString('\n')` method is used to read input from the terminal until a specified delimiter is encountered, which in this case is the newline character (`'\n'`). This means the method will read the user's input until they press the "Enter" key. It returns the input as a string, including the newline character.

Here's an example:

```go
reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
fmt.Print("Enter text: ")
input, err := reader.ReadString('\n')
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error reading input:", err)
}
fmt.Println("You entered:", input)
```

In this example, `reader.ReadString('\n')` reads input until the user presses "Enter" and returns the input string. If an error occurs during reading, it's handled, and the input is printed to the terminal.
