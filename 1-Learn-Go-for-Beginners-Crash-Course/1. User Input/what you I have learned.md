Here's the code with detailed comments explaining what you have learned:

```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	// Create a new reader from standard input
	// This initializes a buffered reader to read input from the console (standard input)
	// `bufio.NewReader` helps read input more efficiently, especially when handling larger input data
	reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)

	// Print a prompt asking the user to enter some text
	// This gives feedback to the user on what the program expects them to do next
	fmt.Print("Enter some text: ")
	
	// Read input until newline character is encountered
	// The `ReadString('\n')` function reads user input until a newline character is encountered
	// This means it captures everything the user types, including the newline
	input, err := reader.ReadString('\n')

	// Check for errors during input reading
	// If there's an error while reading input (e.g., an unexpected end of input), the error is handled here
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error reading input:", err) // Print an error message if something goes wrong
		return                                   // Exit the function early if an error occurs
	}

	// Print the entered text
	// The `input` variable contains what the user typed, including the newline character at the end
	fmt.Println("You entered:", input)
}
```

### **What You've Learned:**
1. **Using `bufio.Reader` for Input:**
   - You learned how to create a buffered reader (`bufio.NewReader`) to handle user input efficiently.
   - This technique is particularly useful when you need to read multiple lines of input or larger amounts of data.

2. **Reading Input with `ReadString('\n')`:**
   - You learned to use `ReadString('\n')` to capture user input until a newline character is encountered.
   - This method reads everything the user types, including the newline, making it simple to capture complete input strings.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - You learned how to handle potential errors when reading input. This is important because input operations can fail (e.g., if the input is interrupted).
   - Checking the error value returned from `ReadString` ensures your program can respond appropriately to issues.

4. **Prompting the User for Input:**
   - You learned to prompt users with `fmt.Print()` before reading input, giving clear instructions on what is expected from them.

5. **Outputting User Input:**
   - You learned to display the captured input using `fmt.Println()`, which helps confirm to the user what was entered.

This code demonstrates essential Go skills for interacting with users, managing input and output, and handling errors gracefullyâ€”fundamental practices in writing interactive command-line programs!
