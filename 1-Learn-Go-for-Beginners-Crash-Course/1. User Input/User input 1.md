Using `bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)` provides more flexibility and control over reading user input compared to `fmt.Scan`, `fmt.Scanln`, and `fmt.Scanf`. The main differences lie in how input is handled, particularly when dealing with complex inputs, multiple lines, or when you need to read the exact input including spaces.

### Key Differences:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `fmt.Scan`, `fmt.Scanln`, and `fmt.Scanf` are designed to handle simple, formatted input. They break input at whitespace or based on specified formatting rules.
   - `bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)` reads the input as a raw stream, allowing you to capture exactly what the user types, including spaces, special characters, and newline characters.

2. **Reading Full Lines**:
   - `bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)` is ideal for reading entire lines or blocks of text without stopping at spaces, which is useful when handling user input that contains spaces.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - `fmt` functions are basic and may not provide detailed control or buffer management. `bufio.NewReader` allows for more sophisticated error checking and buffer management.

### Example with `bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)`

Here's how you can use `bufio.NewReader` to read a full line of input, including spaces:

```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	// Create a new reader from standard input
	reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
	fmt.Print("Enter some text: ")
	
	// Read input until newline character is encountered
	input, err := reader.ReadString('\n')
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error reading input:", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println("You entered:", input)
}
```

### Key Points of `bufio.NewReader`:

1. **Reads Until Specific Character**: `ReadString('\n')` reads until the newline character, capturing the entire line including spaces.
   
2. **Handles Input Better**: Useful for inputs with spaces or when reading multiline input, making it better suited for more complex input scenarios.

3. **Buffered Input**: `bufio.NewReader` uses a buffer, improving performance when reading large amounts of data or when frequently reading from input streams.

### When to Use Which:
- Use `fmt.Scan` functions for simple, structured input when whitespace or format-based separation is fine.
- Use `bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)` when you need more control over input, handle complex strings, or read raw text input without breaking at spaces.
