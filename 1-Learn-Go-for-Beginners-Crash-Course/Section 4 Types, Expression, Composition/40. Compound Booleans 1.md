Here's a demonstration of the concepts discussed earlier, based on the previous explanation, with comments explaining what you've learned:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

// Defining a struct called Employee
// This groups related data (name, age, salary, fullTime status) about an employee.
type Employee struct {
	Name     string
	Age      int
	Salary   int
	FullTime bool
}

func main() {
	// Creating an instance of Employee for Jack
	// Assigning Jack's details including age, salary, and full-time status.
	jack := Employee{
		Name:     "Jack Smith",
		Age:      27,
		Salary:   40000,
		FullTime: false,
	}

	// Creating another instance of Employee for Jill
	// Jill is older, makes more money, and works full-time.
	jill := Employee{
		Name:     "Jill Jones",
		Age:      33,
		Salary:   60000,
		FullTime: true,
	}

	// Creating a slice of employees containing Jack and Jill
	employees := []Employee{jack, jill}

	// Looping through the slice of employees to perform Boolean tests
	for _, employee := range employees {
		// Basic Boolean test: Check if employee is over 30
		if employee.Age > 30 {
			fmt.Println(employee.Name, "is 30 or older.")
		} else {
			fmt.Println(employee.Name, "is under 30.")
		}

		// Using AND (&&) operator to check if the employee is over 30 and earns more than 50,000
		// Both conditions must be true for this message to be printed
		if employee.Age > 30 && employee.Salary > 50000 {
			fmt.Println(employee.Name, "makes more than 50,000 and is over 30.")
		} else {
			fmt.Println(employee.Name, "makes less than 50,000 or is under 30.")
		}

		// Using OR (||) operator to check if the employee is over 30 OR earns more than 50,000
		// Only one of the conditions needs to be true for this message to be printed
		if employee.Age > 30 || employee.Salary > 50000 {
			fmt.Println(employee.Name, "makes more than 50,000 or is over 30.")
		} else {
			fmt.Println(employee.Name, "makes less than 50,000 and is under 30.")
		}

		// Example of a complex condition using AND and OR
		// We want to check if the employee is over 30 OR makes less than 50,000 AND is full-time
		// To improve readability, parentheses are used to clarify the order of evaluation
		if (employee.Age > 30 || employee.Salary < 50000) && employee.FullTime {
			fmt.Println(employee.Name, "matches our unclear criteria.")
		}
	}
}
```

### Comments and What You've Learned:

1. **Structs and Grouping Data**:
   ```go
   type Employee struct {
   	Name     string
   	Age      int
   	Salary   int
   	FullTime bool
   }
   ```
   - You learned that **structs** in Go allow you to group related data together. Here, `Employee` holds the employee’s `Name`, `Age`, `Salary`, and whether they are full-time (`FullTime` is a `bool`).

2. **Creating Employee Instances**:
   ```go
   jack := Employee{
   	Name:     "Jack Smith",
   	Age:      27,
   	Salary:   40000,
   	FullTime: false,
   }

   jill := Employee{
   	Name:     "Jill Jones",
   	Age:      33,
   	Salary:   60000,
   	FullTime: true,
   }
   ```
   - You learned how to create instances of a struct (`jack` and `jill`) and assign them values. Each employee has a `Name`, `Age`, `Salary`, and `FullTime` status.

3. **Basic Boolean Test**:
   ```go
   if employee.Age > 30 {
   	fmt.Println(employee.Name, "is 30 or older.")
   } else {
   	fmt.Println(employee.Name, "is under 30.")
   }
   ```
   - You learned how to perform a simple Boolean test using the `>` operator. This checks if the employee is older than 30 and prints an appropriate message based on the result.

4. **Using AND (`&&`) Operator**:
   ```go
   if employee.Age > 30 && employee.Salary > 50000 {
   	fmt.Println(employee.Name, "makes more than 50,000 and is over 30.")
   } else {
   	fmt.Println(employee.Name, "makes less than 50,000 or is under 30.")
   }
   ```
   - The `&&` operator requires both conditions to be true. Here, you check if the employee is over 30 **and** makes more than 50,000. If both are true, the first message is printed. If either condition is false, the `else` message is printed.

5. **Using OR (`||`) Operator**:
   ```go
   if employee.Age > 30 || employee.Salary > 50000 {
   	fmt.Println(employee.Name, "makes more than 50,000 or is over 30.")
   } else {
   	fmt.Println(employee.Name, "makes less than 50,000 and is under 30.")
   }
   ```
   - The `||` operator allows the condition to be true if **either** part is true. You learned that only one of the conditions (either being over 30 **or** making more than 50,000) needs to be true for the program to print the message.

6. **Complex Boolean Expression Using AND and OR**:
   ```go
   if (employee.Age > 30 || employee.Salary < 50000) && employee.FullTime {
   	fmt.Println(employee.Name, "matches our unclear criteria.")
   }
   ```
   - In this case, the parentheses are used to clarify the order of operations, ensuring that `employee.Age > 30 || employee.Salary < 50000` is evaluated first, and then that result is combined with `employee.FullTime`. The message is printed if this entire condition is true.
   - You learned that **parentheses** can be used to improve readability and ensure that the logic is clear, especially in complex Boolean expressions.

### Final Thoughts:
- **Boolean logic** is used throughout your program to make decisions about data, such as employee details.
- You’ve learned how to use basic operators (`>`, `&&`, `||`), struct data types, and control flow (`if-else`) to manipulate and evaluate conditions.
- **Parentheses** help make complex conditions easier to read and understand, and you learned that they are useful for clarifying the order in which conditions should be evaluated.
