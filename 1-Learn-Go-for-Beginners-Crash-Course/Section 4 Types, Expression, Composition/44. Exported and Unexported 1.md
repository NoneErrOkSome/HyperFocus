Here’s a Go program based on the concept of **exported** and **unexported** functions, variables, and types. It demonstrates how to organize code into packages and control what is accessible outside the package using uppercase and lowercase naming conventions.

### Folder Structure:
```
myapp/
    ├── main.go
    ├── go.mod
    └── staff/
        └── staff.go
```

### `main.go` (in the root folder)
This file is the entry point of your application. It uses the `staff` package.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"myapp/staff"
)

func main() {
	// Initialize employees data using the staff package
	employees := []staff.Employee{
		{FirstName: "John", LastName: "Smith", Salary: 30000, FullTime: true},
		{FirstName: "Sally", LastName: "Jones", Salary: 50000, FullTime: true},
		{FirstName: "Mark", LastName: "Smithers", Salary: 60000, FullTime: true},
		{FirstName: "Alan", LastName: "Anderson", Salary: 15000, FullTime: false},
		{FirstName: "Margaret", LastName: "Carter", Salary: 100000, FullTime: true},
	}

	// Initialize staff.Office with the employees data
	myStaff := staff.Office{
		AllStaff: employees,
	}

	// Print all employees using the exported All function
	log.Println("All employees:", myStaff.All())

	// Set custom Overpaid limit and print overpaid employees
	staff.OverpaidLimit = 50000 // This is an exported variable, so it can be modified from here
	log.Println("Overpaid employees:", myStaff.Overpaid())

	// Print underpaid employees using the default underpaid limit (unexported)
	log.Println("Underpaid employees:", myStaff.Underpaid())

	// Attempt to call unexported function - This will not work, so it's commented out
	// myStaff.notVisible()

	// Call the package-level function
	staff.MyFunction() // This works as it's an exported function
}
```

### `staff.go` (in the `staff` folder)
This file defines the `staff` package, including structs, functions, and variables. It controls what can be accessed from outside the package.

```go
package staff

import "log"

// Employee struct: Exported because it starts with an uppercase letter
type Employee struct {
	FirstName string
	LastName  string
	Salary    int
	FullTime  bool
}

// Office struct: Exported because it starts with an uppercase letter
type Office struct {
	AllStaff []Employee
}

// OverpaidLimit: Exported package-level variable, can be accessed and modified from other packages
var OverpaidLimit = 75000

// underpaidLimit: Unexported package-level variable, cannot be accessed outside of the staff package
var underpaidLimit = 20000

// All: Exported function to return all employees
func (e Office) All() []Employee {
	return e.AllStaff
}

// Overpaid: Exported function to return employees whose salary exceeds OverpaidLimit
func (e Office) Overpaid() []Employee {
	var overpaid []Employee
	for _, emp := range e.AllStaff {
		if emp.Salary > OverpaidLimit {
			overpaid = append(overpaid, emp)
		}
	}
	return overpaid
}

// Underpaid: Exported function to return employees whose salary is below underpaidLimit
// This limit is unexported, so it cannot be changed from outside the package
func (e Office) Underpaid() []Employee {
	var underpaid []Employee
	for _, emp := range e.AllStaff {
		if emp.Salary < underpaidLimit {
			underpaid = append(underpaid, emp)
		}
	}
	return underpaid
}

// notVisible: Unexported function, not accessible outside the staff package
func (e Office) notVisible() {
	log.Println("This function is not visible outside the package.")
}

// MyFunction: Exported package-level function without a receiver
// It can be used anywhere within the package and outside the package.
func MyFunction() {
	log.Println("I am a function from the staff package.")
}
```

### `go.mod` (in the root folder)
This file is used for managing the Go module. You can replace `myapp` with your own module path.

```
module myapp

go 1.18
```

### Explanation:

1. **Exported Types and Functions**:
   - **Employee**, **Office**, and functions like `All()`, `Overpaid()`, and `MyFunction()` all start with uppercase letters, so they are exported. This means they can be accessed from other packages (like `main.go`).
   
2. **Unexported Types and Functions**:
   - Variables like `underpaidLimit` and the function `notVisible()` start with lowercase letters, making them **unexported**. They are only accessible within the `staff` package and cannot be used in `main.go`.

3. **Access to Package-Level Variables**:
   - `OverpaidLimit` is an exported variable, meaning it can be modified in `main.go` to change the salary threshold for overpaid employees.
   - `underpaidLimit` is unexported, so the salary threshold for underpaid employees cannot be changed from `main.go`.

4. **Receiver Functions**:
   - Functions like `All()`, `Overpaid()`, and `Underpaid()` are tied to the `Office` struct using receivers (`e Office`). These functions can access the fields of the `Office` struct, like `AllStaff`.

5. **Package-Level Functions**:
   - `MyFunction()` is an exported function that can be called without needing a receiver. It can be used inside or outside the package.

### Output:

When you run the program, the output will look something like this:

```
2024/09/30 12:00:00 All employees: [{John Smith 30000 true} {Sally Jones 50000 true} {Mark Smithers 60000 true} {Alan Anderson 15000 false} {Margaret Carter 100000 true}]
2024/09/30 12:00:00 Overpaid employees: [{Mark Smithers 60000 true} {Margaret Carter 100000 true}]
2024/09/30 12:00:00 Underpaid employees: [{Alan Anderson 15000 false}]
2024/09/30 12:00:00 I am a function from the staff package.
```

### What You've Learned:
- **Exported vs. Unexported**: By using uppercase and lowercase letters, you control which parts of the code are visible and accessible outside the package.
- **Structs and Receivers**: Structs like `Employee` and `Office` define types that can hold data, and receiver functions tied to these types allow for operations on that data.
- **Modular Code**: Packages enable you to organize code into logical units, while exported functions and variables ensure you can reuse the code across different parts of your application.
