Here’s a Go program based on the concept of **composition** discussed earlier, with comments explaining each step. This example will implement the `Vehicle` and `Car` structs using composition, avoiding inheritance and demonstrating the flexibility and simplicity of Go's design.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

// Defining the Vehicle struct
// This will hold common properties of a vehicle, such as number of wheels and number of passengers.
type Vehicle struct {
	NumberOfWheels   int
	NumberOfPassengers int
}

// Defining a method for the Vehicle type called ShowDetails
// This method will print out the number of wheels and passengers of the vehicle.
func (v Vehicle) ShowDetails() {
	fmt.Println("Number of passengers:", v.NumberOfPassengers)
	fmt.Println("Number of wheels:", v.NumberOfWheels)
}

// Defining the Car struct, which has its own fields, plus it embeds Vehicle.
// This allows Car to inherit the fields and methods of Vehicle without using inheritance.
type Car struct {
	Make       string
	Model      string
	Year       int
	IsElectric bool
	IsHybrid   bool
	Vehicle    // This is composition; Car now has all the fields and methods of Vehicle.
}

// Defining a method for the Car type called Show
// This method will print out car-specific information and call the embedded Vehicle's ShowDetails method.
func (c Car) Show() {
	fmt.Println("Make:", c.Make)
	fmt.Println("Model:", c.Model)
	fmt.Println("Year:", c.Year)
	fmt.Println("Is Electric:", c.IsElectric)
	fmt.Println("Is Hybrid:", c.IsHybrid)
	// Accessing the Vehicle's ShowDetails method to print vehicle-specific information
	c.Vehicle.ShowDetails()
}

func main() {
	// Creating a vehicle instance
	// This will be used inside our Car type.
	suv := Vehicle{
		NumberOfWheels:   4,
		NumberOfPassengers: 6,
	}

	// Creating a Car instance using composition
	// The Car instance will have access to both its own fields and the embedded Vehicle fields.
	volvo := Car{
		Make:       "Volvo",
		Model:      "XC90",
		Year:       2021,
		IsElectric: false,
		IsHybrid:   true,
		Vehicle:    suv, // Embedding the suv Vehicle struct
	}

	// Calling the Show method, which will print both Car-specific and Vehicle-specific details.
	volvo.Show()

	fmt.Println() // Blank line for better formatting

	// Creating another Car instance (Tesla) using the same composition technique
	tesla := Car{
		Make:       "Tesla",
		Model:      "Model X",
		Year:       2021,
		IsElectric: true,
		IsHybrid:   false,
		Vehicle: Vehicle{
			NumberOfWheels:   4,
			NumberOfPassengers: 5,
		},
	}

	// Displaying the Tesla details
	tesla.Show()

	// Modifying a field directly (No need for getters or setters)
	// Changing the number of passengers for Tesla from 5 to 7.
	tesla.Vehicle.NumberOfPassengers = 7

	fmt.Println("\nAfter modifying the number of passengers for Tesla:")
	tesla.Show()
}
```

### Explanation with Comments:

1. **Struct Definition**:
   ```go
   type Vehicle struct {
       NumberOfWheels   int
       NumberOfPassengers int
   }
   ```
   - We define a `Vehicle` struct that holds common properties such as `NumberOfWheels` and `NumberOfPassengers`.

2. **Embedding a Struct (Composition)**:
   ```go
   type Car struct {
       Make       string
       Model      string
       Year       int
       IsElectric bool
       IsHybrid   bool
       Vehicle    // Embedding the Vehicle struct inside Car
   }
   ```
   - The `Car` struct has its own fields (`Make`, `Model`, `Year`, etc.), but it also embeds the `Vehicle` struct, which allows it to inherit the fields and methods of `Vehicle`. This is composition in action.

3. **Receiver Functions**:
   - The `ShowDetails` method is tied to the `Vehicle` type and prints vehicle-specific details like the number of passengers and wheels:
     ```go
     func (v Vehicle) ShowDetails() {
         fmt.Println("Number of passengers:", v.NumberOfPassengers)
         fmt.Println("Number of wheels:", v.NumberOfWheels)
     }
     ```
   - The `Show` method is tied to the `Car` type and prints car-specific information like `Make`, `Model`, and calls `Vehicle.ShowDetails()` to display the embedded vehicle details:
     ```go
     func (c Car) Show() {
         fmt.Println("Make:", c.Make)
         fmt.Println("Model:", c.Model)
         fmt.Println("Year:", c.Year)
         fmt.Println("Is Electric:", c.IsElectric)
         fmt.Println("Is Hybrid:", c.IsHybrid)
         c.Vehicle.ShowDetails() // Calling the Vehicle's method
     }
     ```

4. **Creating Instances and Accessing Embedded Structs**:
   - We create a `Vehicle` instance called `suv` and a `Car` instance called `volvo` that embeds the `suv`:
     ```go
     suv := Vehicle{
         NumberOfWheels:   4,
         NumberOfPassengers: 6,
     }

     volvo := Car{
         Make:       "Volvo",
         Model:      "XC90",
         Year:       2021,
         IsElectric: false,
         IsHybrid:   true,
         Vehicle:    suv,
     }
     ```

5. **Calling Methods**:
   - We call the `Show` method on the `volvo` and `tesla` instances. This method displays both car-specific details (like `Make`, `Model`, `IsElectric`) and vehicle-specific details (like `NumberOfPassengers` and `NumberOfWheels`).

6. **Direct Access to Fields (No Getters/Setters Required)**:
   - Unlike object-oriented languages like PHP or Java, Go doesn’t require getters and setters to modify struct fields. We directly modify the `NumberOfPassengers` for `tesla` and rerun the `Show` method to see the updated value:
     ```go
     tesla.Vehicle.NumberOfPassengers = 7
     ```

### Output:

```bash
Make: Volvo
Model: XC90
Year: 2021
Is Electric: false
Is Hybrid: true
Number of passengers: 6
Number of wheels: 4

Make: Tesla
Model: Model X
Year: 2021
Is Electric: true
Is Hybrid: false
Number of passengers: 5
Number of wheels: 4

After modifying the number of passengers for Tesla:
Make: Tesla
Model: Model X
Year: 2021
Is Electric: true
Is Hybrid: false
Number of passengers: 7
Number of wheels: 4
```

### What You've Learned:
- **Composition** in Go is achieved by embedding structs, which allows one struct (e.g., `Car`) to include the fields and methods of another struct (e.g., `Vehicle`).
- Unlike inheritance in object-oriented programming, composition is more flexible and modular, reducing code duplication.
- **Receiver methods** allow you to attach functions to structs, making the code more organized and easy to read.
- Go doesn’t require **getters or setters**; you can modify struct fields directly, simplifying data manipulation.
