Here's your code with comments that describe what you’ve learned:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

	// This line starts a new go routine. 
	// The function 'doSomething' runs concurrently with the rest of the main function.
	go doSomething("Hello, world")

	// This line prints immediately because go routines are non-blocking.
	// The main function doesn't wait for the go routine to finish or start.
	fmt.Println("This is another message")

	// The infinite loop ensures that the main function keeps running, 
	// preventing the program from exiting before the go routine has completed.
	// If we didn’t have this loop, the main function might finish before the go routine executes.
	for {
		// do something
	}

}

// The 'doSomething' function runs in a separate go routine.
// It prints the string passed to it 5 times and then exits.
func doSomething(s string) {
	until := 0
	// The loop will print the value of 's' 5 times before breaking.
	for {
		// Print the string along with the message
		fmt.Println("s is", s)
		// Increment the 'until' variable to track the number of prints.
		until = until + 1
		// Break the loop after printing the message 5 times.
		if until >= 5 {
			break
		}
	}
}
```

### Comments and Learnings:
1. **Go routines**: You’ve learned how to start a go routine using the `go` keyword. This allows `doSomething` to run concurrently with the main function.
2. **Non-blocking nature of go routines**: The `fmt.Println("This is another message")` executes immediately after starting the go routine because go routines are non-blocking.
3. **Infinite loop in the main function**: Without this infinite loop, the program would terminate before the go routine could finish its work. The loop keeps the main function alive, allowing the go routine to complete.
4. **Go routine concurrency**: The `doSomething` function runs in the background concurrently and prints the string 5 times before exiting.

The line `fmt.Println("This is another message")` is printed first before the output from the `go routine` because of how **Go handles concurrency**.

### Explanation:
- When you use the `go` keyword before a function call (in this case, `go doSomething("Hello, world")`), Go creates a **go routine**, which is essentially a lightweight, concurrent thread of execution.
- However, **go routines are non-blocking**. This means that when you start a go routine, the program doesn't wait for the go routine to finish or even start; it simply continues executing the next line of code in the main function.
- In your case, after starting the go routine, the program immediately moves on to the next line: `fmt.Println("This is another message")`, and prints that message.
- Meanwhile, the go routine runs **concurrently** in the background. There may be a slight delay before the go routine starts executing, which is why you see the message "This is another message" printed first.
- After the main function prints its message, the go routine starts executing and prints "s is Hello, world" multiple times until the `until` variable reaches 5.

### Key Point:
Go routines allow the main program to continue executing while the go routine runs independently. Since the `fmt.Println` call is executed directly in the main function, it will always run first unless the go routine starts and completes instantly (which is unlikely in most cases due to how Go schedules go routines). 

### Example of the flow:
1. Main function starts.
2. `go doSomething("Hello, world")` is executed, but the go routine runs in the background.
3. The next line, `fmt.Println("This is another message")`, is immediately executed and prints to the console.
4. Meanwhile, the go routine prints "s is Hello, world" concurrently.

That’s why "This is another message" appears before the go routine's output.
