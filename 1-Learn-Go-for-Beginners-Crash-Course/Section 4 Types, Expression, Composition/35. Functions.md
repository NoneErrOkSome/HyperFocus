Here are the key concepts extracted from the transcript, using the instructor's own words:

### 1. **Function Definition**:
   - "We've already seen functions, so we've seen things like this."
   - "I can create a new function right here, `func addTwoNumbers`, and it takes two parameters... returns a type of int."
   - "That's as simple as return `x + y`."

### 2. **Named Return**:
   - "I can, in fact, if I want to, name the return type."
   - "This is called the naked return."
   - "Technically, you can do it, but in practice, you almost never see this."
   - "The Go authors say only use the naked return for very short functions because it makes readability worse."

### 3. **Variadic Functions**:
   - "I want to talk about different kinds of functions... I'll create a new function called `sumMany`."
   - "It's going to take an argument, but a variable number of arguments."
   - "This is what's called a variadic function, a function that takes any number of arguments."
   - "Your variadic one needs to be at the very end because, of course, you can only have one in the list of parameters."

### 4. **Receiver Functions (Methods)**:
   - "Now I'm actually going to give this type functions. Functions that are available anytime we use a variable of this type."
   - "I do that simply by giving the functions another little bit of information, and it's called a receiver."
   - "This is called a receiver... it comes right after the `func` keyword and before the function name."
   - "What this does is anytime you call this function, it will take the value of the current `Animal` and use it inside that function."

### 5. **Attaching Functions to Structs**:
   - "We can actually have functions attached to types."
   - "The function `says` is available to the variable `dog` because it is of the type `Animal`, and `Animal` has this nice little receiver function called `says`."
   - "And I can give it as many functions as I want."

### 6. **Shorthand Initialization for Structs**:
   - "Let's create another animal... and we'll do this one using the shorthand."
   - "We'll say `cat` is assigned the value of type `Animal`, and inside of this, we'll populate all the necessary information."

### 7. **Adding More Methods to Structs**:
   - "I can create another one here saying `func (a *Animal) howManyLegs`."
   - "It's really, really straightforward."
   - "You'll see that all the time in Go, and it works really, really well."

These extracted concepts focus on the fundamentals of function definitions, variadic functions, and methods (receiver functions) in Go. They demonstrate how functions can be applied to structs and how Go allows methods to be tied to specific types, using the instructor's own phrasing.
