Here is how the full program is structured, including the **`staff`** package and its usage in the **`main.go`** file.

### Folder Structure:
```
myapp/
    ├── main.go
    ├── go.mod
    └── staff/
        └── staff.go
```

### `main.go` (in the root folder)
This file is the entry point of your application and uses the `staff` package to manage employees and offices.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"myapp/staff" // Importing the staff package
)

func main() {
	// Create a list of employees
	employees := []staff.Employee{
		{FirstName: "John", LastName: "Doe", Salary: 30000, FullTime: true},
		{FirstName: "Jane", LastName: "Doe", Salary: 40000, FullTime: false},
		{FirstName: "Emily", LastName: "Smith", Salary: 55000, FullTime: true},
	}

	// Create an Office and assign the employees
	myOffice := staff.Office{
		AllStaff: employees,
	}

	// Call the All() method to get all employees in the office
	allEmployees := myOffice.All()

	// Print out all employees
	fmt.Println("Employees in the office:")
	for _, emp := range allEmployees {
		fmt.Printf("%s %s, Salary: %d, FullTime: %t\n", emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, emp.Salary, emp.FullTime)
	}
}
```

### `staff.go` (inside the `staff` folder)
This is the `staff` package, which defines the `Employee` and `Office` structs and provides a method to retrieve all employees.

```go
package staff

// Employee struct represents an individual employee
type Employee struct {
	FirstName string
	LastName  string
	Salary    int
	FullTime  bool
}

// Office struct represents an office that holds a list of employees
type Office struct {
	AllStaff []Employee
}

// All method returns all the employees in the office
func (e *Office) All() []Employee {
	return e.AllStaff
}
```

### `go.mod` (in the root folder)
This file is used for managing the Go module. You can replace `myapp` with your own module path.

```
module myapp

go 1.18
```

### Explanation of the Code:

#### 1. **Package `staff`**:
- The **`staff`** package defines two main structs: `Employee` and `Office`.
  - **`Employee`**: This struct stores details about an employee, such as `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Salary`, and `FullTime` status.
  - **`Office`**: This struct stores a slice of `Employee` instances in the `AllStaff` field.
  
- The **`All()`** method attached to `Office` returns the slice of employees (`AllStaff`).

#### 2. **How `main.go` and `staff.go` Work Together**:
- In **`main.go`**, the program imports the `staff` package to use the types and methods defined there.
  - It creates a slice of employees (using the `Employee` struct) and stores it in the `AllStaff` field of the `Office` struct.
  - The `All()` method is called on the `Office` instance to retrieve and print the list of employees.

#### 3. **Linking Structs and Methods**:
- The **`Office`** struct contains a slice of `Employee` structs, allowing you to manage multiple employees.
- The **`All()`** method provides a convenient way to access all the employees in the office by returning the slice stored in the `AllStaff` field.

### Output:
When you run the program, the output will be:

```
Employees in the office:
John Doe, Salary: 30000, FullTime: true
Jane Doe, Salary: 40000, FullTime: false
Emily Smith, Salary: 55000, FullTime: true
```

### What You've Learned:
- **Structs** allow you to group related data fields, like `Employee` with `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Salary`, and `FullTime`.
- **Packages** help organize your code. The `staff` package holds logic related to employees and offices, which is then used in `main.go`.
- **Receiver Functions** like `All()` operate on specific struct instances, allowing you to encapsulate logic related to that struct.
- **Pointer Receivers** (`*Office`) let the method access and manipulate the actual data inside the struct without copying it.

This setup demonstrates how to structure a Go program using multiple packages and how structs and methods are used to manage data.
