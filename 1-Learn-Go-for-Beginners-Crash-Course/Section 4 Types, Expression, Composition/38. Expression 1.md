Here are the key concepts extracted from the transcript, using the instructor's words with added **clarification** for better understanding:

### 1. **Introduction to Expressions**:
   - "We've been using expressions all through this course so far, but we haven't actually referred to them by name."
     - **Clarification**: An expression is a fundamental concept in programming. Although you're constantly using them, it's essential to understand what they are explicitly. Expressions are bits of code that result in a single value when evaluated.

### 2. **Literals vs. Expressions**:
   - "On line four, we have `age` assigned the int literal of 10. `name` is assigned the string literal `jack`, and `rightHanded` is assigned the Boolean literal of `true`."
     - **Clarification**: A **literal** is a fixed value assigned directly to a variable, such as `10` (integer literal), `"jack"` (string literal), or `true` (Boolean literal). Literals are not evaluated at runtime; they are hardcoded values.

   - "Even though this variable `rightHanded` is assigned the Boolean literal of `true`, when it's evaluated in the `Printf` line, it becomes an expression."
     - **Clarification**: A variable assignment with a literal becomes an **expression** when the value of the variable is substituted during runtime. For instance, `rightHanded = false` changes its value at runtime, and when evaluated in an expression like `Printf`, it reflects the updated value.

### 3. **What is an Expression?**:
   - "An expression is nothing more than a value that can be evaluated to a single value."
     - **Clarification**: An expression is any combination of variables, operators, and values that can be evaluated to produce a result. For example, `age + 10` or `age >= 13` are both expressions because they result in a single value (e.g., `20` or `false`).

### 4. **Examples of Expressions**:
   - "For example, `ageIn10Years` is assigned the value of `age + 10`. This part right here, `age + 10`, that's an expression because it can be evaluated to a single value."
     - **Clarification**: Expressions can involve arithmetic operations like `age + 10`. The result is a single value, which in this case, is `20` if `age = 10`.
   
   - "Another example is `isTeenager`, which is assigned the value of `age >= 13`. This is a valid expression because `age >= 13` evaluates to a Boolean value (either `true` or `false`)."
     - **Clarification**: Expressions can also be comparisons, like `age >= 13`, which evaluates to either `true` or `false` based on the value of `age`.

### 5. **Expressions in Print Statements**:
   - "On line 13, we have another expression: `age + 10`, which can be evaluated to `20` in this case."
     - **Clarification**: Expressions are commonly used in `Printf` or `Println` statements where variables are evaluated at runtime to substitute placeholders like `%d`, `%s`, etc., with actual values.

   - "In total, we have eight expressions in our 20 lines of code."
     - **Clarification**: While literals like `10`, `"jack"`, and `true` aren't expressions themselves, lines involving evaluation (e.g., `age + 10` or `age >= 13`) are expressions. Identifying how many expressions exist in your code is a useful exercise to understand what parts are evaluated dynamically.

### 6. **Assignment Rules with Expressions**:
   - "You can't do something like `age + 10 = 20` because that's not permitted. Expressions must appear on the right-hand side of the assignment operator."
     - **Clarification**: In Go (and many other languages), expressions must always appear on the **right-hand side** of an assignment (`=`). You cannot assign a value to an expression (e.g., `age + 10 = 20`), as expressions represent computed values, not variables.

### 7. **Key Point about Expressions**:
   - "Expressions are nothing more than some bit of code that can be evaluated to a single value."
     - **Clarification**: At their core, expressions are simple. They're bits of code that, when evaluated, yield a single result. You will use expressions in practically every line of code, whether you're doing arithmetic, comparisons, or calling functions. Understanding them helps to clarify how data flows through your program.

### Summary of What I've Learned:
- **Literals**: Fixed values directly assigned to variables. They are not expressions but are used within expressions.
- **Expressions**: Any part of the code that can be evaluated to a single value at runtime. These include operations like `age + 10` or comparisons like `age >= 13`.
- **Expressions in Action**: When using `Printf`, expressions are evaluated, and their results are used to substitute placeholders like `%d` or `%s`.
- **Assignment Rules**: Expressions must always be on the right side of the `=` operator.
- **Expressions Are Everywhere**: Even though you might not explicitly refer to them by name, expressions are a fundamental part of almost all code, from variable assignments to condition checks.
