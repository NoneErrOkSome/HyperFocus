In my own **mathematical scope**, a **polynomial** is defined as an algebraic expression consisting of variables, coefficients, and exponents combined using **addition, subtraction, and multiplication**, where the exponents are **non-negative integers**.

### **Formal Definition**

A **polynomial** in one variable (say, $x$) is an expression of the form:

P(x)=anxn+anâˆ’1xnâˆ’1+â‹¯+a2x2+a1x+a0P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \dots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0

where:

- $a_n, a_{n-1}, ..., a_0$ are **coefficients** (usually real or complex numbers),
- $n$ is a **non-negative integer** (degree of the polynomial),
- $x$ is the **variable**.

### **Key Properties of Polynomials**

1. **Degree of a Polynomial**: The highest exponent of the variable.
    
    - Example: $4x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 7$ has **degree 3**.
2. **Classification by Degree**:
    
    - **Constant Polynomial**: Degree $0$ (e.g., $7$).
    - **Linear Polynomial**: Degree $1$ (e.g., $3x + 2$).
    - **Quadratic Polynomial**: Degree $2$ (e.g., $x^2 - 4x + 1$).
    - **Cubic Polynomial**: Degree $3$ (e.g., $2x^3 - x^2 + 3x - 5$).
    - **Higher-degree polynomials**: (quartic, quintic, etc.).
3. **Operations on Polynomials**:
    
    - **Addition**: Combine like terms.
    - **Subtraction**: Distribute negatives and combine terms.
    - **Multiplication**: Use distributive property or FOIL for binomials.
    - **Division**: Polynomial long division or synthetic division.
4. **Factoring Polynomials**:
    
    - **Greatest Common Factor (GCF)**: Factor out the highest common term.
    - **Trinomial Factoring**: Factor quadratic expressions.
    - **Difference of Squares**: $a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)$.
    - **Factoring by Grouping**: Split middle term and factor in pairs.
5. **Polynomial Theorems**:
    
    - **Remainder Theorem**: If $P(x)$ is divided by $(x - c)$, then the remainder is $P(c)$.
    - **Factor Theorem**: If $P(c) = 0$, then $(x - c)$ is a factor of $P(x)$.
    - **Fundamental Theorem of Algebra**: Every polynomial of degree $n$ has exactly $n$ roots (including complex roots).
