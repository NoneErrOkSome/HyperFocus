Ah, I see what you mean now! You're asking for a **foundation in mathematics** that dives into the **conceptual** and **symbolic** structure of math, rather than the simplified or practical versions typically taught in school. You want to understand how math works at a deeper, more foundational level, from the ground up—but not through the school curriculum, which often simplifies things to focus on calculations.

This would be more like starting from **first principles** of math, where you don't just take numbers and operations for granted, but instead, explore where they come from and how they’re defined.

Here’s an approach that avoids the standard school curriculum, focusing on building math from logical foundations and formal structures:

### 1. **Mathematical Logic (The Core)**  
   This is the true foundation of all mathematics. Before you even get to numbers, you need to understand **logic**—how mathematical reasoning works.  
   - **Propositional logic**: How statements are either true or false.
   - **Predicate logic**: How we use quantifiers like "for all" (`∀`) and "there exists" (`∃`).
   - **Proof techniques**: How to build and verify logical arguments using direct proof, contradiction, and induction.

### 2. **Set Theory (The Building Blocks of Math)**  
   Set theory formalizes the concept of collections of objects, and it's the basis for everything in modern mathematics. In this approach, numbers themselves are defined as sets!
   - **Basic set operations**: Union, intersection, difference.
   - **Relations and functions**: How we define relationships between sets.
   - **Cardinality**: How to talk about the size of sets, including infinite sets.

### 3. **Number Construction (Defining Numbers Theoretically)**  
   Instead of starting with arithmetic like in school, you learn how numbers are actually **constructed** from logic and set theory. This builds up from the most basic number concepts:
   - **Natural numbers**: Defined using **Peano's axioms**, a set of rules that describe how numbers work.
   - **Integers**: Extending natural numbers to include negatives.
   - **Rational numbers**: Constructing fractions as pairs of integers.
   - **Real numbers**: Understanding continuous quantities through limits and **Dedekind cuts**.

### 4. **Algebraic Structures (Abstracting Arithmetic)**  
   Instead of doing arithmetic directly, you'd learn about algebra as a system of **operations** and **structures** that abstract numbers into more general concepts.
   - **Groups**: How sets with a single operation (like addition or multiplication) behave.
   - **Rings and fields**: Extending group theory to include more operations (like both addition and multiplication).
   - **Polynomials and equations**: Formalizing algebraic manipulation through these structures.

### 5. **Geometry and Topology (Visualizing Spaces)**  
   Instead of traditional geometry taught in school, you’d study the foundations of space and form in a more abstract sense.
   - **Euclidean geometry**: Exploring the formal system of points, lines, and planes.
   - **Non-Euclidean geometries**: Different types of spaces with alternative rules.
   - **Topology**: Studying properties of space that remain unchanged under stretching or bending (continuity, connectedness).

### 6. **Real Analysis (Formalizing Calculus)**  
   This is where calculus is defined rigorously, with formal definitions of limits, continuity, and integrals. Instead of just learning to differentiate and integrate, you'd learn **why** those operations work.
   - **Limits**: The foundation of how we define change and continuity.
   - **Derivatives**: Formalized using limits.
   - **Integrals**: Defined as limits of sums, explaining area under curves.
   
### 7. **Category Theory (High-Level Abstraction)**  
   If you really want to see how mathematics is connected at the highest level, category theory explores relationships between different mathematical structures. This is an abstract area that is highly general but shows how different areas of math fit together.
   - **Objects and morphisms**: Core elements of category theory.
   - **Functors**: Maps between categories that preserve structure.
   - **Natural transformations**: Ways of transforming one functor into another while preserving structure.

### Conclusion:
This approach would **build math from the ground up**, focusing on the **underlying concepts** and **symbolic structures** rather than the calculations taught in school. Instead of starting with arithmetic, you'd start with **logic** and **set theory**, and then build up **numbers**, **algebra**, and **geometry** from those foundations. It’s about understanding math **conceptually** and **structurally**.
