If we were to **replace the school curriculum** with a version that focuses on the **conceptual and symbolic structure of math**, here's how we could align it with different education levels:

### 1. **Primary Level (Elementary School)**
   - **Mathematical Logic Basics**: Introduce very basic propositional logic. Focus on understanding what true/false means and how simple logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) work. This replaces basic arithmetic with a focus on how **statements** can be **reasoned** through.
   - **Set Theory Foundations**: Teach the concept of sets, collections of objects, and simple operations on them (union, intersection, complement) instead of only working with numbers.
   - **Number Construction (Natural Numbers)**: Instead of just using numbers for counting, explain the **Peano axioms** to show how natural numbers are formally constructed and why we count the way we do.

   **Goal**: Lay the groundwork for understanding math **as a logical system** rather than just a tool for calculations.

### 2. **Lower Secondary (Middle School)**
   - **Predicate Logic**: Introduce quantifiers like "for all" (`∀`) and "there exists" (`∃`). This replaces some of the early algebra and geometry with more logical thinking about **statements involving variables**.
   - **Constructing Integers and Fractions**: Instead of jumping straight into negative numbers and fractions, teach **how** integers are constructed from natural numbers, and how rational numbers (fractions) are **defined** formally as pairs of integers.
   - **Basic Algebraic Structures**: Start introducing the idea of a **group**: a set with an operation (like addition or multiplication) that follows specific rules. This would be a more conceptual replacement for early algebra, focusing on **why operations work**.

   **Goal**: Begin to introduce abstract thinking, teaching students **why math is structured** the way it is.

### 3. **Upper Secondary (High School)**
   - **Abstract Algebra (Groups, Rings, Fields)**: Instead of focusing on traditional algebra and calculus, teach students how **groups**, **rings**, and **fields** are generalizations of numbers and operations. This would show why algebra works in the abstract sense.
   - **Geometry and Topology**: Go beyond Euclidean geometry and introduce **non-Euclidean geometries** (e.g., hyperbolic and spherical geometries), and basic **topological concepts** like continuity and connectedness. This would give students a deeper understanding of **spaces** and how they can differ from our intuitive geometry.
   - **Real Number Construction (Limits and Continuity)**: Teach how the real numbers are constructed using **Dedekind cuts** or **Cauchy sequences** and why limits are important for understanding continuous functions. This could replace some of the early calculus, giving a deeper understanding of **why limits** work.

   **Goal**: Shift from mechanical problem-solving to **abstract reasoning** and deep understanding of **algebraic and geometric structures**.

### 4. **Post-Secondary (University Preparation)**
   - **Real Analysis**: Replace traditional calculus courses with **real analysis**, where students learn to prove the core results of calculus, such as the formal definitions of limits, derivatives, and integrals.
   - **Set Theory and Logic**: Dive deeper into formal set theory, learning about cardinality, infinite sets, and basic model theory. This replaces rote application of mathematical formulas with an understanding of **how we define structures**.
   - **Category Theory (Introductory Level)**: Start introducing the ideas of **category theory**, where students see math from the highest level of abstraction, focusing on the relationships between different mathematical structures.

   **Goal**: Prepare students for university-level math by ensuring they have a strong **theoretical foundation**, allowing them to reason through **any mathematical system**.

---

### Summary:
Each education level would replace traditional curriculum components like arithmetic, algebra, and calculus with a more **conceptual and symbolic** approach, focusing on **why math works** rather than how to compute answers. The journey would begin with basic logical thinking and set theory, building up toward abstract algebra and real analysis, with a final introduction to the high-level abstraction of category theory.

This way, by the time students reach advanced levels, they are equipped not just with problem-solving skills, but with a deep understanding of the **structure of mathematics**.
