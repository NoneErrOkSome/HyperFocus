At the start of **Step 4**, the speaker explains:

---

## ⚠️ Problem with Blindly Using Techniques

- The issue with just using **lots of random techniques** is:
    
    - **There are so many of them**.
        
    - **Some work**, **some don’t**.
        
    - **Some work sometimes**, and **sometimes they don’t**.
        
- So it becomes **very hard** to figure out:
    
    - Which technique to use?
        
    - In which situation?
        
    - When to apply it?

## 🛠️ The Real Solution:

- Instead of relying on **lists of tips**,  
    **you should focus on two main principles** that **always matter** for short-term focus.

# 🧠 The 2 Prerequisites for Short-Term Focus Success

### 1️⃣ **Prioritize Deep Work**

- **Deep Work** means:
    
    - Locking in on **one single task**.
        
    - **Entering a flow state** where:
        
        - Time seems to fly.
            
        - Brain is **super engaged**.
            
        - Focus **comes naturally**.
            
    - Your brain reaches its **peak level of efficiency**.
        

---

## 💡 Deep Work — Key Points

- **Rule of thumb**:
    
    - Anything that **increases your ability to do Deep Work** = **good**.
        
    - Anything that **hinders Deep Work** = **bad**, even if it feels productive.
        
- There’s a lot of research on how to create Deep Work states.  
    But without overwhelming you, the speaker shares:

## 🧾 His Personal Deep Work Checklist

When preparing for Deep Work:

---

### 📝 (1) **Have a Clear Objective**

- Before starting, **know exactly**:
    
    - What you want to achieve **in that session**.
        
- **Do not** just block time for "study" or "work" without specifics.
    
- **Be specific**:
    
    - After 15, 20, 30, at most 60 minutes — you should **clearly know** what you were supposed to have achieved.
        
- 🎯 **Clear, focused objective** = tunnel vision for your brain = better focus.
    

---

### 📝 (2) **Only Do One Task at a Time**

- **Multitasking is a myth**:
    
    - Nobody can truly multitask.
        
    - People who seem good at multitasking are just **rapidly switching tasks**.
        
- Every time you switch tasks:
    
    - You suffer a **Cognitive Switching Penalty**:
        
        - Brain needs to **switch out** of the previous task.
            
        - Brain needs to **reboot** into the new one.
            
        - It wastes time and creates chances for distractions.
            
- If you switch a lot:
    
    - Even if you "work" for 1 hour, maybe **half** of it is wasted just on switching.
        
- 🎯 **Focus on exactly one task** at a time — finish it or reach the clear milestone before moving on.

### 📝 (3) **Prep the Hard Stuff in Advance**

- If the task feels **big or overwhelming**:
    
    - **Do a small, easy preparation step** beforehand.
        
    - Examples:
        
        - Plan out the work.
            
        - Gather the necessary resources.
            
- Why?
    
    - Reduces overwhelm.
        
    - **Gives future-you a head start**.
        
- This leverages the **Zeigarnik Effect**:
    
    - A psychological phenomenon where:
        
        - Once you start a task (even a little),
            
        - Your brain becomes **more motivated** to complete it.
            

---

### 📝 (4) **Plan to Start — Not to Finish**

- When you face a huge task:
    
    - If you **plan to "finish" it**, your brain gets intimidated.
        
    - It feels like a **massive energy drain**.
        
- Instead:
    
    - **Only plan to start**.
        
    - Tell yourself:
        
        - _“I’ll just start and see how far I get.”_
            
- Why?
    
    - Reduces resistance.
        
    - Makes it much easier to get into a **Flow State**.
        
- Often, once you start:
    
    - You **enter flow**.
        
    - You **get far more done** than you expected.

✅ **Summary of Deep Work Prerequisite**:  
If a tip or technique **helps you achieve these checklist points**, it's probably a **good** short-term strategy.

### 2️⃣ **Frontloading: Setting Yourself Up for Success**

- **Frontloading** means:
    
    - Doing things **in advance** to **make success easier later**.
        
- Research shows:
    
    - People with great discipline are not born "more motivated."
        
    - Instead, they **set themselves up beforehand** to make it easier to succeed.

## 🧩 Examples of Frontloading

- Want to run in the morning?
    
    - **Lay out your running clothes and shoes** the night before — **right by the door**.
        
- Want to study productively?
    
    - **Prepare textbooks, browser tabs, and notes** ahead of time.
        
    - **Clear your desk** before the study session starts.
        
- ✅ The goal:
    
    - When it’s time to act, you **remove all barriers**.
        
    - You have **no excuses**.
        
    - You only need a **tiny bump of motivation** to begin.

## 🚪 Remove Distractions Ahead of Time

- Think about **what will distract you**:
    
    - Loud environment?
        
        - **Prepare noise-canceling headphones** and a focus playlist.
            
    - Phone distractions?
        
        - **Put your phone on "Do Not Disturb"** or **leave it in another room**.
            
- ✏️ Important:
    
    - It’s **not enough** to plan to remove distractions during your work session.
        
    - You must **remove them far in advance**:
        
        - The night before.
            
        - The day before.
            
        - Even the week before if possible.
            
- Otherwise:
    
    - When you are about to start, dealing with distractions last minute causes:
        
        - **Procrastination**.
            
        - **Energy loss**.
            
        - **Loss of momentum**.
            

---

✅ **Summary of Frontloading Prerequisite**:  
Set up your environment so that **starting** is easy, and **distractions** are already **neutralized**.
