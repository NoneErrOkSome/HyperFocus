# 🟦 **Part 2 — Step 1: Understand Your Win Criteria**

(full details, no summarization, fully preserved)

---

The speaker explains in **Step 1**:

---

## 🎯 What is “Win Criteria”?

- A **Win Criteria** is:
    
    - **What needs to happen** for you to **consider** that you have "**won**."
        
- Example:
    
    - In chess, you win by **checkmating your opponent** or **they forfeit**.

## 🚨 Problem: Most People Have the Wrong Win Criteria for Focus

- Most people think:
    
    - **If they apply a technique** (like a tip or trick) **and manage to focus for a bit**, then **they have succeeded**.
        
- The speaker **strongly disagrees**:
    
    - That’s **not how focus works**.
        
    - That is a **misunderstanding** of the **real goal**.

## 🧠 Personal Story: His Early Gym Mistake

The speaker shares a personal example to illustrate this mistake:

- **Years ago**, when he started working out:
    
    - He **wanted to throw heavy weights around** without properly focusing on **good form** or **health**.
        
    - As a result:
        
        - He **hurt his wrist**.
            
        - He **hurt his shoulders** — **both shoulders**.
            
- To solve the _pain_:
    
    - He got **wrist wraps**.
        
    - He did some **postural stretches** (shoulder-opening activities).
        
- But after treating the pain, he **kept throwing heavy weights** with **bad form**.
    
- What happened?
    
    - **The injury got worse**.
        
    - He needed **even thicker wrist wraps**.
        
    - He applied **Tiger Balm** (pain relief ointment).
        
    - He took **ibuprofen** (painkiller).

## 📌 The Deeper Lesson from His Story:

- His **Win Criteria** at that time was:
    
    - **“Not feeling pain.”**
        
- But **the pain was not the real problem**.
    
- The pain was just the **symptom**.
    

> ✏️ **The Real Problem**:  
> His **bad lifting form** caused the injuries in the first place.

## 🔥 Applying That Lesson to Focus and Attention Span

- **Pain = Symptom** in the gym story.
    
- **Inability to focus = Symptom** in attention problems.
    

> ✏️ **The real focus problem is not solved** just by using a tip to sit down and focus for a few hours.

- The speaker emphasizes:
    
    - **The true Win Criteria** is **not**:
        
        - Sitting down for a study session using tips and managing to focus for a few hours.
            
    - **The true Win Criteria is**:
        
        - Having the **ability to focus deeply and consistently** **without needing tons of external tricks and techniques**.

## 📈 Important Visualization:

The speaker describes a mental picture:

- Imagine a **graph**:
    
    - There’s a **barrier** — like a **wall** you must overcome to **have good attention**.
        
    - The **wall = distractions**.
        
- If your **baseline focus level** is **low** (below the wall):
    
    - You will need **lots of tips and techniques** every time you want to get over the wall and into Focus.
        
- **Real cure**:
    
    - **Raise your baseline innate focus level**.
        
    - So that **you naturally stay above the wall**.
        
    - **No need for constant external techniques**.
        

---

## 🚨 Urgency:

- The speaker warns:
    
    - If you keep relying on techniques without fixing your real attention ability,
        
    - **You will constantly need more and more tips**.
        
    - **And** those tips **will become less effective over time**.
        
- If you feel like **your tips are already getting less effective** and **you need more and more help to focus**,  
    then it’s a **critical warning sign**:  
    You must urgently fix your **innate attention** — not just keep adding more temporary solutions.
