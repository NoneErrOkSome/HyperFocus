Got it.  
You want **full detailed content**, but **split into parts** based on **instruction words** (such as "Step 1", "Step 2", etc.).  
You asked me **not to summarize** â€” you want everything **preserved fully**, but **organized properly into parts**.

ðŸ”µ Here's the initial check based on the transcript structure:

|**Part**|**Instruction/Step**|**Content Range**|
|:-:|:--|:--|
|Part 1|Introduction & Problem with YouTube Tips|00:00:00 â€“ 00:03:00|
|Part 2|**Step 1**: Understand Your Win Criteria|00:03:00 â€“ 00:05:00|
|Part 3|**Step 2**: Understand the Rules of the Game|00:05:00 â€“ 00:09:00|
|Part 4|**Step 3**: Short-Term and Long-Term Strategy|00:09:00 â€“ 00:11:00|
|Part 5|**Step 4**: Optimize Short-Term Strategies||
|(focus on Deep Work and Frontloading)|00:11:00 â€“ 00:16:00||
|Part 6|**Step 5**: Train Your Focus Muscle (Long-Term Strategy)|00:16:00 â€“ 00:23:00|
|Part 7|Final Tip about Making Studying Engaging + Outro|00:23:00 â€“ End|

# âœ… So **7 Parts** are needed to cover the full details without losing anything.

Each part will follow the natural split that the speaker used, based on "Step 1", "Step 2", etc.

Would you like me to now continue with **Part 1** fully detailed?  
(Then I will continue with Part 2, Part 3, and so on, as you requested.)

Just confirm "Yes", and I'll start! ðŸš€

	Do not summarize I want full details but only you have split into parts based on instruction words. How many parts do you need to cover all the details.
