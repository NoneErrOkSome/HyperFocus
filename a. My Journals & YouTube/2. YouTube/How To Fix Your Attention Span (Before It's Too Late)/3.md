# 🟦 **Part 3 — Step 2: Understand the Rules of the Game**

(full details, no summarization, fully preserved)

---

At the start of **Step 2**, the speaker explains:

---

## 🧠 The Current Situation: Your Innate Attention Span

- Right now, **your natural baseline attention span** may be **pretty low**.
    
- You might think:
    
    - _“Over time, it will naturally get better”_,  
        or
        
    - _“I can’t really be bothered to actively train it — it’s fine.”_
        

🚫 But the speaker warns:

- **That thinking will NOT work.**
    
- **Attention span does not naturally improve** over time.
    

---

## 🛑 Critical Rule of the Game:

> ✏️ **If you do not actively train your attention span, it will actually get worse.**

- Just by living normally in today’s society,  
    **your attention span is constantly being eroded**.

## 🌎 Why? The Modern World Is Training You the Wrong Way

- We are **being bombarded every day**:
    
    - **Billions of dollars** are spent by **multi-trillion-dollar companies** to:
        
        - **Hack your attention**.
            
        - **Capture your focus**.
            
        - **Hold you on their platforms longer**.
            
- **Attention is the new currency**.
    
- Even the speaker admits:
    
    - As a YouTube video creator, **he has to think constantly about your attention span** too.
        
        - (In his case, he tries to keep your attention **long enough to teach you how to improve it** — ironically.)
            

---

## 🔥 Urgency:

- If you are **not** actively training your attention span,
    
    - The **default path** is that **it will get weaker**.
        
- This means:
    
    - **Over time**, it becomes **harder and harder** to break through the "**distraction wall**" and focus.
        
- You will eventually need even **more extreme setups** just to create focus.

## 🧑‍🎓 Student Example: Extreme Focus Environment

- The speaker shares a real example:
    
    - He had a student a few years ago.
        
- What she did:
    
    - **Cleared out her entire garage** — **only left a desk inside**.
        
    - **Locked herself in**:
        
        - No laptop.
            
        - No phone.
            
        - Only a **textbook** and **pen and paper** (old-school studying).
            
    - She **gave the keys to her family**.
        
        - To go to the bathroom, she had to **knock on the door** and get **permission**.
            
- The speaker **credits her seriousness**, but warns:
    

> ✏️ **If it takes that much extreme isolation just to focus**,  
> then **life will be very difficult** when trying to achieve **big, meaningful goals**.

## 📣 The Good News

- You **can** train your attention span.
    
- You **must** train it **quickly**.
    
- Because:
    
    - **The rules of the game** are:
        
        - **Your attention is being untrained by default.**
            
        - **You must train faster than it's being untrained**.
