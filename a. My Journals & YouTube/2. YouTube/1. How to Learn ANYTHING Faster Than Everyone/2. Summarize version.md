# 🧠 How to Learn Anything Faster Than Everyone (One-Page Quick Review)

---

## 1️⃣ Effort–Time Exchange

**Key idea:**

- **More effort during learning = faster overall mastery.**
    
- Easy learning delays true memory and understanding.
    
- Real learning happens when you **struggle** to process, connect, and recall ideas (**Generation Effect**).
    

**Key action:**

- Always check: _Am I reaching the right level of struggle?_
    
- Engage deeply while reading, writing notes, and recalling.

## 2️⃣ Omni-Learner Principle

**Key idea:**

- **No such thing as a "best learning style."**
    
- Must be able to learn from **reading**, **listening**, **visuals**, **practice** — everything.
    

**Key action:**

- Always ask: _How can I organize this?_
    
- Organize information actively: simplify, rearrange, connect ideas.
    
- Don’t passively understand — actively **restructure knowledge**.

## 3️⃣ Iteration Effect

**Key idea:**

- **Learning = hypothesis + feedback loop.**
    
- Testing only near exams = disaster.
    
- **Early and frequent testing** reveals gaps while easy to fix.
    

**Key action:**

- Test yourself **weekly**, **after every session**.
    
- Use **micro-retrieval**: recall immediately after learning.
    
- Welcome mistakes — they are feedback, not failure.

# 🎯 Core Mindset Shift

> "**Learning faster is not about making learning easier —  
> it's about embracing active struggle, mastering all input types,  
> and building fast feedback loops.**"

---

✅ Apply effort early → save massive time later.  
✅ Become an omni-learner → 100% of input turns into learning.  
✅ Maximize iteration → Lightbulb moments happen faster.
