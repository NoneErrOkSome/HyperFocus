### **4. Common Mistakes with "Ought to"**

- **Incorrect**: "You **ought** see a doctor."

Unlike "should," "ought to" always includes "to" when followed by another verb.

    - **Correct**: "He **must** be there for sure."

#### **c. Overusing in Casual Contexts**

- "Ought to" is a bit more formal and can sound out of place in casual conversations where "should" is typically used.
    - **Formal**: "We **ought to** review the guidelines carefully." (Sounds appropriate)
    - **Casual**: "We **should** review the guidelines carefully." (More natural in casual speech)
