## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### 1. Using the Wrong Form After Certain Verbs

**Incorrect**: She **suggested** **to go** to the museum.

**Correct**: She **suggested** **going** to the museum.

**Tip**: Remember that "suggest" is followed by a gerund.

### 2. Double Infinitives or Gerunds

**Incorrect**: He wants **to to study** abroad.

**Correct**: He wants **to study** abroad.

**Tip**: Ensure only one "to" precedes the verb.

### 3. Using Gerunds After Prepositions

**Incorrect**: She is good at **to sing**.

**Correct**: She is good at **singing**.

**Tip**: After a preposition, use a gerund.

### 4. Confusion with "To" as a Preposition vs. Part of an Infinitive

**Incorrect**: They look forward **to meet** you.

**Correct**: They look forward **to meeting** you.

**Explanation**: In this case, "to" is a preposition following "look forward," so it should be followed by a gerund.

## Special Cases

### Gerunds After Phrasal Verbs

Phrasal verbs are often followed by gerunds.

**Examples**:

- He **gave up** **smoking**.
- They **keep on** **working** despite the difficulties.

### Infinitives of Purpose

Infinitives can express the purpose of an action.

**Examples**:

### Passive Infinitives and Gerunds

Sometimes, it's necessary to use the passive form.

**Passive Infinitive**:

- They expect **to be promoted**.

**Passive Gerund**:

- She dislikes **being ignored**.

---

## Advanced Considerations

### Perfect Gerunds and Infinitives

#### Perfect Gerund: **Having + Past Participle**

Used to emphasize that the action of the gerund happened before the action of the main verb.

**Example**:

- **Having finished** his work, he went home.

#### Perfect Infinitive: **To have + Past Participle**

Used after certain verbs to indicate that the action of the infinitive happened before the action of the main verb.

**Example**:

- She seems **to have forgotten** the meeting.

### Verbs of Perception

When verbs of perception (see, hear, feel, watch) are followed by an object and then an infinitive without "to" (bare infinitive) or a present participle.

**Bare Infinitive**:

- I **saw** him **leave** the building.

**Present Participle**:

- I **saw** him **leaving** the building.

**Difference in Meaning**:

- **Bare Infinitive**: The action is complete.
- **Present Participle**: The action is ongoing.
