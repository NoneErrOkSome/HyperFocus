Got it! Here’s a **deep dive into the topics mentioned by the speaker** regarding linking words, focusing on **how** and **when** to use them, their **differences**, and **examples** to help clarify their meanings and usage.

---

### **1. Linking Words: "So" and "Because"**

**"So"** and **"Because"** are often used to **explain reasons** or **results**. However, they serve different roles in a sentence.

#### **a. "So"**

- **Meaning**: "So" is used to indicate a **result** or **consequence** of something.
- **Structure**: Typically, "so" follows a clause that explains the reason.
    - _Example_: _"It was raining, **so** we took an umbrella."_
- **Usage**: "So" provides an answer to the question **"What happened next?"** It is more focused on the result of an action.

#### **b. "Because"**

- **Meaning**: "Because" is used to explain the **reason** why something happened.
- **Structure**: "Because" is used to start the clause that explains the reason.
    - _Example_: _"We took an umbrella **because** it was raining."_
- **Usage**: "Because" provides an answer to the question **"Why?"** It gives a direct cause for the action.

#### **c. Key Differences**

- **"Because"** gives the reason: _"We took an umbrella because it was raining."_
- **"So"** gives the result: _"It was raining, so we took an umbrella."_

### **2. Synonyms for "Because": "Since" and "As"**

**"Since"** and **"As"** are often used as alternatives to "because," especially in formal writing.

#### **a. "Since"**

- **Two Meanings**:
    1. **Reason**: Similar to "because."
        - _Example_: _"We took an umbrella **since** it was raining."_
    2. **Time**: Refers to when something started.
        - _Example_: _"I haven’t seen her **since** last week."_
- **Usage Tip**: When using "since" to mean "because," it emphasizes a **reason** but can sometimes be more formal or less direct.

#### **b. "As"**

- **Meaning**: Similar to "because," "as" can also indicate a reason.
    - _Example_: _"We left early **as** we had to catch a flight."_
- **Usage Tip**: "As" is generally used in more **formal** contexts and often puts less emphasis on the reason compared to "because."

### **3. "Although," "But," and Concession vs. Contrast**

**"Although"** and **"But"** are linking words used to present a difference, **contradiction**, or **unexpected contrast**.

#### **a. "Although"** (Concession)

- **Meaning**: "Although" is used for **concession**, meaning there is something **unexpected** or **surprising**.
- **Structure**: "Although" can be used at the beginning or in the middle of a sentence.
    - _Example_: _"**Although** it was raining, she went for a walk."_
- **Key Idea**: Concession involves surprise or something against expectations.
    - _"**Although** it was cold, she wasn't wearing a coat."_ (Unexpected)

#### **b. "But"** (Contrast)

- **Meaning**: "But" shows **contrast** between two ideas. It highlights a **difference** without necessarily implying a surprise.
- **Structure**: "But" is usually placed in the middle of a sentence.
    - _Example_: _"She was tired, **but** she continued working."_
- **Usage Tip**: Use "but" to contrast two straightforward ideas.
    - _"It was raining, **but** we still had a great time."_ (Shows two contrasting ideas)

#### **c. Synonyms of "Although"**:

- **"Though"** and **"Even though"**: These have the same meaning as "although" and can be used interchangeably.
    - _Example_: _"**Even though** it was late, he kept studying."_

#### **Key Differences**:

- **Concession** (using "although") often implies surprise: _"**Although** it was very expensive, they bought it."_
- **Contrast** (using "but") directly compares two different aspects: _"The hotel was expensive, **but** it was worth it."_

### **4. Formal Alternatives: "Therefore"**

**"Therefore"** is a more **formal** linking word that serves a similar function as "so" but is used in more **academic** or **formal** contexts.

#### **a. Meaning and Usage**

- **Meaning**: "Therefore" shows the **result** of something and works similarly to "so."
- **Structure**: Often used after a semi-colon or in a new sentence.
    - _Example_: _"It was raining heavily; **therefore**, we decided to stay indoors."_
- **Usage Tip**: Prefer "therefore" for **formal writing** (e.g., essays, reports), while "so" is better for **informal contexts**.

### **5. Linking Words for Time: "When" and "While"**

**"When"** and **"While"** are both used to talk about **time** and **events happening** simultaneously. They are often used with **past simple** and **past continuous** tenses.

#### **a. "When"**

- **Meaning**: "When" refers to **a specific moment** in time or an event that happened at a particular point.
    - _Example_: _"I broke my leg **when** I was playing football."_
- **Usage with Tenses**: Commonly used with **past simple** to introduce a single event.
    - _"When I arrived, she was cooking."_

#### **b. "While"**

- **Meaning**: "While" is used to refer to **two actions happening at the same time** for a certain period.
    - _Example_: _"I was reading **while** she was cooking."_
- **Usage with Tenses**: Frequently used with **past continuous** because it indicates longer actions that overlap.
    - _"**While** I was waiting, I read a book."_

#### **c. Future Tense with "When"**

- **Special Rule**: When using "when" to talk about the future, **don’t use "will"** in the "when" clause.
    - _Correct_: _"I will call you **when** I get there."_
    - _Incorrect_: _"I will call you **when I will** get there."_

#### **Usage Tips**:

- **When** can indicate both **past** and **future** actions, while **while** typically shows two **continuous** actions happening at the same time.

### **6. Conditional Linking Words: "If" vs. "When"**

**"If"** and **"When"** are both used to introduce **conditions**, but there is an important distinction:

#### **a. "If"**

- **Meaning**: Refers to something that **may or may not happen**.
    - _Example_: _"I will help you **if** you need me."_ (Uncertain if the condition will be met)

#### **b. "When"**

- **Meaning**: Refers to something that **is expected** to happen.
    - _Example_: _"I will call you **when** I arrive."_ (Expected to happen at some point)

#### **c. Key Differences**

- Use **"if"** for conditions that **may** occur: _"If it rains, we will stay inside."_
- Use **"when"** for conditions that are **certain**: _"When I finish my work, I will call you."_

#### **Special Rule**:

- For both **"if"** and **"when"** used in the future tense, **do not use "will"** in the conditional clause:
    - _Correct_: _"I will go home if it **gets** late."_
    - _Incorrect_: _"I will go home if it **will get** late."_
