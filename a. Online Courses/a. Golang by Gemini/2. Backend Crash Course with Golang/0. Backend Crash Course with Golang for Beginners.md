Okay, building on the foundational knowledge from a general Golang crash course, here's how I'd structure a **Backend Crash Course with Golang for Beginners**:

This course assumes participants have completed a basic Golang crash course (like the one previously outlined) and understand Go fundamentals (syntax, control flow, structs, interfaces, goroutines, channels).

## Backend Crash Course with Golang for Beginners üåê

This course focuses on building web APIs and services using Go. It emphasizes practical application, common patterns, and essential tools for backend development.

---

### Module 1: Introduction to Backend Development & HTTP

- **What is a Backend?**
    - Client-Server Architecture.
    - Role of the backend (business logic, data storage, APIs).
    - Stateless vs. Stateful services.
- **HTTP Fundamentals (The Language of the Web):**
    - Request/Response cycle.
    - HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH).
    - Status Codes (2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx).
    - Headers (Content-Type, Authorization, etc.).
    - URL structure (scheme, host, path, query parameters).
- **Introduction to APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):**
    - What is an API? Why do we need them?
    - RESTful API principles (brief overview).
    - Common data formats: JSON.
- **Go's `net/http` Package (The Foundation):**
    - Creating a basic HTTP server.
    - Handling requests (`http.HandleFunc`, `http.Handler`).
    - Writing responses (`ResponseWriter`).
    - Reading request bodies and query parameters.

**‚û°Ô∏è Practical Exercise:**

- Build a very simple HTTP server in Go that responds with "Hello, Backend!" to a GET request.
- Extend it to handle different paths and return different messages.
- Parse a query parameter from the URL and include it in the response.

### Module 2: Building RESTful APIs in Go

- **Designing API Endpoints:**
    - Resource-oriented design.
    - Choosing appropriate HTTP methods for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- **Working with JSON:**
    - Encoding Go structs to JSON (`encoding/json` - `Marshal`).
    - Decoding JSON requests into Go structs (`encoding/json` - `Unmarshal`).
    - Setting `Content-Type: application/json` headers.
- **Routing:**
    - Limitations of `net/http`'s default router for complex APIs.
    - Introduction to a popular routing package (e.g., `gorilla/mux` or `chi`).
        - Path parameters (e.g., `/users/{id}`).
        - Method-based routing (e.g., `router.HandleFunc("/users", ...).Methods("GET")`).
- **Structuring Your API Code:**
    - Separating handlers, models (data structures), and potentially service logic.
    - Basic project layout for a web service.

**‚û°Ô∏è Practical Exercise (Running Project - Part 1):**

- Start building a simple "To-Do List" API.
- Implement endpoints for:
    - `POST /todos` - Create a new to-do item (initially store in an in-memory slice).
    - `GET /todos` - Get all to-do items.
    - `GET /todos/{id}` - Get a specific to-do item by ID.
- Use a third-party router like `gorilla/mux` or `chi`.
- Ensure requests and responses use JSON.

### Module 3: Data Persistence

- **Why We Need Databases.**
- **Types of Databases (Brief Overview):**
    - Relational (SQL) - e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL.
    - NoSQL - e.g., MongoDB, Redis.
- **Interacting with SQL Databases in Go:**
    - The `database/sql` package (standard library).
    - Drivers for specific databases (e.g., `lib/pq` for PostgreSQL, `go-sql-driver/mysql` for MySQL).
    - Connecting to a database.
    - Executing queries (`Query`, `QueryRow`, `Exec`).
    - Handling results and scanning into structs.
    - Prepared statements.
    - Basic transaction management.
- **(Optional Introduction) ORMs/Query Builders:**
    - Brief mention of popular libraries like GORM or SQLBoiler/sqlc and their pros/cons. For a crash course, focus on `database/sql` first.

**‚û°Ô∏è Practical Exercise (Running Project - Part 2):**

- Set up a simple local PostgreSQL or SQLite database.
- Modify the "To-Do List" API to store to-do items in the database instead of in-memory.
- Implement the `UPDATE` and `DELETE` endpoints:
    - `PUT /todos/{id}` - Update an existing to-do item.
    - `DELETE /todos/{id}` - Delete a to-do item.

### Module 4: Middleware, Configuration, and Error Handling

- **Middleware:**
    - What is middleware? (e.g., logging, authentication, CORS).
    - Writing basic middleware in Go (functions that wrap `http.Handler`).
    - Using middleware with your chosen router.
    - Common middleware examples:
        - Request logging.
        - Recovery (panic handling).
        - Setting common headers (e.g., CORS).
- **Configuration Management:**
    - Why hardcoding is bad.
    - Using environment variables.
    - Reading configuration from files (JSON, YAML - e.g., using `viper`).
- **Robust Error Handling in APIs:**
    - Returning appropriate HTTP status codes for different errors.
    - Standardized JSON error responses.
    - Centralized error handling approaches.

**‚û°Ô∏è Practical Exercise (Running Project - Part 3):**

- Add logging middleware to your "To-Do List" API to log every incoming request (method, path).
- Add a recovery middleware to catch panics and return a 500 error gracefully.
- Move database connection details to environment variables or a configuration file.
- Implement consistent JSON error responses for cases like "item not found" (404) or validation errors (400).

### Module 5: Authentication & Authorization (Basics)

- **Authentication vs. Authorization.**
- **Basic Authentication (Conceptual Overview).**
- **Token-Based Authentication (e.g., JWT - JSON Web Tokens):**
    - How JWTs work (Header, Payload, Signature).
    - Creating (signing) JWTs upon login.
    - Validating JWTs from request headers (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
    - Introduction to a Go JWT library (e.g., `golang-jwt/jwt`).
- **Password Hashing:**
    - Why you MUST hash passwords (e.g., using `golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt`).
- **(Brief) Authorization Concepts:**
    - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - conceptual.

**‚û°Ô∏è Practical Exercise:**

- Add basic user registration (`POST /register`) and login (`POST /login`) endpoints to a _new, separate simple service_ (or greatly simplify the To-Do API for this exercise).
    - Registration should hash and store user credentials (in-memory or DB).
    - Login should verify credentials and return a JWT.
- Create a protected endpoint (e.g., `GET /me`) that requires a valid JWT to access. Implement middleware to check for the JWT.

### Module 6: Testing Your Backend

- **Why Test Your API?**
- **Unit Testing Handlers and Logic (recap `testing` package).**
- **Integration Testing for APIs:**
    - Using `net/http/httptest` to make mock HTTP requests to your handlers without needing a running server.
    - Checking status codes and response bodies.
- **Table-Driven Tests for multiple scenarios.**
- **(Brief) End-to-End Testing concepts.**

**‚û°Ô∏è Practical Exercise (Running Project - Part 4):**

- Write integration tests for the "To-Do List" API endpoints using `httptest`.
    - Test creating a to-do item and then retrieving it.
    - Test error cases (e.g., trying to get a non-existent to-do item).

### Module 7: Deployment & Next Steps

- **Building Go Binaries for Production.**
- **Introduction to Docker:**
    - Why Docker? (Consistency, isolation).
    - Writing a simple `Dockerfile` for your Go application.
    - Building and running a Docker container.
- **(Brief) Cloud Deployment Options Overview:**
    - VPS, PaaS (e.g., Heroku, Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk), CaaS (e.g., Kubernetes).
- **Monitoring and Logging in Production (Conceptual).**
- **Further Learning:**
    - Advanced Go concurrency patterns for backend.
    - gRPC.
    - GraphQL.
    - Microservices architecture.
    - Specific cloud provider services.
    - Security best practices in depth.

**‚û°Ô∏è Practical Exercise:**

- Write a `Dockerfile` for your "To-Do List" API.
- Build a Docker image and run it locally.
- Test the API running inside the Docker container.

**Throughout the Course:**

- **Focus on Idiomatic Go:** Encourage clean, simple, and Go-like solutions.
- **Live Coding & Debugging:** Show, don't just tell.
- **Recommended Tools:**
    - IDE: VS Code with Go extension, or GoLand.
    - API Client: Postman, Insomnia, or curl.
- **Security Considerations:** Briefly mention security implications at relevant points (e.g., SQL injection, XSS - though detailed coverage is out of scope for a crash course).

This structure provides a solid foundation for beginners to start building backend services with Go, covering essential concepts from HTTP basics to deployment considerations. The running project helps solidify learning through continuous application.
