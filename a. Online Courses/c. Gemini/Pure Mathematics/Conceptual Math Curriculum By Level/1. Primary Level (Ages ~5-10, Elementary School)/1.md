Okay, I understand perfectly now. You're looking for a serious, foundational explanation of these logical concepts, suitable for an adult learner starting from first principles, rather than a simplified version for children. My apologies for the previous misunderstanding.

Let's break down these "Foundations of Reasoning" (which is essentially the beginning of **Propositional Logic**) from the ground up:

### Foundations of Reasoning: An Introduction to Propositional Logic

At its core, mathematical reasoning relies on understanding how statements can be combined and how their truth or falsity can be systematically determined. Propositional logic provides the framework for this.

#### 1. **Propositions and Truth Values (Truth and Falsity)**

- Definition of a Proposition:
    
    A proposition (or statement) is a declarative sentence that has a definite truth value: it is either true (T) or false (F), but not both, and not neither. The truth value must be an objective property, not a matter of opinion or dependent on time/context unless specified.
    
    - **Examples of Propositions:**
        
        - "The Earth is a planet." (True)
        - "2 + 2 = 5." (False)
        - "Paris is the capital of France." (True)
        - "All squares have four equal sides." (True)
    - **Examples of Non-Propositions:**
        
        - "What time is it?" (This is a question, not a declarative sentence.)
        - "Close the door." (This is a command.)
        - "This statement is false." (This is a paradoxical statement, often called a liar paradox, and not a simple proposition with a clear truth value in standard propositional logic.)
        - "x + 1 = 3." (This is a predicate or open sentence; its truth value depends on the value of 'x'. Once 'x' is specified, it becomes a proposition, e.g., "If x=2, then x+1=3" is true.)
        - "Mathematics is interesting." (This is subjective and opinion-based.)
- Truth Values:
    
    Every proposition is assigned one of two truth values: T (True) or F (False). These are fundamental to logic. We often use variables like p,q,r,… to represent propositions.
    

#### 2. **Logical Connectives (Combining Propositions)**

Logical connectives are operators used to form more complex propositions (called **compound propositions**) from simpler ones. The truth value of a compound proposition is entirely determined by the truth values of its constituent propositions and the definitions of the connectives used.

Let p and q be propositions.

- **a) Negation (NOT)**
    
    - **Symbol:** ¬p (read as "not p"). Other symbols include ∼p or p​.
    - **Definition:** The negation of a proposition p is true if p is false, and false if p is true. It simply reverses the truth value.
    - **Truth Table:**

| p   | ¬p  |
|-----|-----|
| T   | F   |
| F   | T   |
    - **Example:** If p: "It is raining." (True) Then ¬p: "It is not raining." (False)
- **b) Conjunction (AND)**
    
    - **Symbol:** p∧q (read as "p and q").
        
    - **Definition:** The conjunction of p and q is true if and only if _both_ p and q are true. If either p or q (or both) are false, then p∧q is false.
        
    - Truth Table:
        
        | p | q | p∧q |
        
        |-----|-----|-------------|
        
        | T | T | T |
        
        | T | F | F |
        
        | F | T | F |
        
        | F | F | F |
        fix this table pls



| p   | q   | p∧q |
|-----|-----|-----|
| T   | T   | T   |
| T   | F   | F   |
| F   | T   | F   |
| F   | F   | F   |

This table correctly represents the truth values for the conjunction of two propositions, \( p \) and \( q \). The conjunction \( p∧q \) is true only when both \( p \) and \( q \) are true.
    - Example:
        
        Let p: "The number 7 is prime." (True)
        
        Let q: "The number 7 is odd." (True)
        
        Then p∧q: "The number 7 is prime and the number 7 is odd." (True)
        
        Let r: "The number 6 is prime." (False)
        
        Let s: "The number 6 is odd." (False)
        
        Then r∧s: "The number 6 is prime and the number 6 is odd." (False)
        
        And p∧r: "The number 7 is prime and the number 6 is prime." (False)
        
- **c) Disjunction (OR)**
    
    - **Symbol:** p∨q (read as "p or q").
        
    - **Definition:** The disjunction of p and q is true if _at least one_ of p or q (or both) is true. It is false only when both p and q are false. This is known as an **inclusive OR**.
        
    - Truth Table:
    
| p   | q   | p∨q |
|-----|-----|-----|
| T   | T   | T   |
| T   | F   | T   |
| F   | T   | T   |
| F   | F   | F   |


The table you provided for the disjunction (OR) truth values is already correctly formatted. However, I can present it again for clarity:

| p   | q   | p∨q |
|-----|-----|-----|
| T   | T   | T   |
| T   | F   | T   |
| F   | T   | T   |
| F   | F   | F   |


    - Example:
        
        Let p: "Students who have completed calculus can take this course."
        
        Let q: "Students who have the instructor's permission can take this course."
        
        Then p∨q: "Students who have completed calculus or who have the instructor's permission can take this course." This is true if a student satisfies either condition, or both.
        
        Let r: "It will rain today."
        
        Let s: "It will snow today."
        
        r∨s: "It will rain today or it will snow today." This is true if it rains, if it snows, or if both occur (though unlikely for some climates, logically it's true). It's only false if neither happens.
        
    
    _(Note: There is also an "exclusive or" (XOR, often symbolized by ⊕), which means "p or q, but not both." However, in formal logic, "OR" (∨) by default refers to the inclusive OR.)_
    

#### 3. **Conditional Statements (If-Then Thinking)**

- **Symbol:** p→q (read as "if p, then q" or "p implies q").
- **Terminology:**
    - p is called the **antecedent** (or hypothesis, premise).
    - q is called the **consequent** (or conclusion).
- **Definition:** The conditional statement p→q is false if and only if p is true and q is false. In all other cases, p→q is true. This definition can seem counterintuitive at first, especially the cases where p is false. The reasoning is that if the premise (p) is false, the implication hasn't been violated, regardless of the truth value of the conclusion (q). The statement p→q essentially makes a promise: "If p holds, then q will hold." If p doesn't hold, the promise is not broken.
- **Truth Table:** | p | q | p→q | |-----|-----|-------------------| | T | T | T | | T | F | F | | F | T | T | | F | F | T |
- **Examples:**
    - Let p: "You get an A on the final exam." (Antecedent)
        
        Let q: "You will pass the course." (Consequent)
        
        p→q: "If you get an A on the final exam, then you will pass the course."
        
        - If you get an A (T) and pass (T), the statement is True.
        - If you get an A (T) but don't pass (F), the promise was broken; the statement is False.
        - If you don't get an A (F) but still pass (T), the promise wasn't broken; the statement is True.
        - If you don't get an A (F) and don't pass (F), the promise wasn't broken; the statement is True.
    - "If it is raining (p), then the ground is wet (q)."
        
        - Raining (T), ground wet (T) → True.
        - Raining (T), ground not wet (F) → False (this scenario breaks the implication).
        - Not raining (F), ground wet (T) (e.g., sprinklers) → True (the "if raining" condition wasn't met, so the implication still holds).
        - Not raining (F), ground not wet (F) → True.
    - "If 2+2=5 (p), then the moon is made of green cheese (q)."
        
        Here, p is False. According to the truth table, regardless of whether q is true or false, the entire statement p→q is True. This highlights that logical implication doesn't always align with common-sense causality but rather with the formal definition based on truth values.
        

These concepts – propositions, truth values, and the precise definitions of logical connectives (especially their truth tables) – are the absolute bedrock upon which more complex logical arguments and mathematical proofs are built. Understanding them thoroughly is crucial for progressing in formal reasoning.
