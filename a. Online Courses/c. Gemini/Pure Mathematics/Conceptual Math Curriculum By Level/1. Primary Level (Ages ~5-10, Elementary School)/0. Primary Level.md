### 1. **Primary Level (Ages ~5-10, Elementary School)**

Focus: Nurturing intuitive understanding of logic, collections, and the nature of numbers as ordered concepts.

- **Foundations of Reasoning (Logic for Little Thinkers)**:
    - **Truth and Falsity**: Exploring statements about their immediate world (e.g., "The sun is hot," "My toy is blue") and identifying them as true or false.
    - **Simple Logical Connectives**: Introducing concepts like "AND" (both conditions must be true), "OR" (at least one condition is true), "NOT" (the opposite is true) through games, stories, and simple sorting activities. For example, "Find a toy that is red AND soft."
    - **If-Then Thinking**: Basic conditional reasoning through scenarios: "If it is raining, then we use an umbrella."
- **Exploring Collections (Intuitive Set Theory)**:
    - **What is a Collection?**: Identifying and forming groups (sets) of familiar objects based on shared properties (e.g., "the set of all blue blocks," "the set of animals that fly").
    - **Belonging and Not Belonging**: Understanding the concept of an element being in a set or not.
    - **Combining and Separating Collections**: Introducing visual and hands-on ways to understand:
        - **Union**: "What if we put all your red toys and all your blue toys together?"
        - **Intersection**: "Which toys are in _both_ the 'soft toys' collection AND the 'animal toys' collection?"
        - **Complements/Differences (simple forms)**: "What toys are in your big box but NOT in the 'car toys' collection?"
    - **Comparing Collections**: Early ideas of "more than," "less than," "same amount as" through one-to-one correspondence between elements of sets, laying an intuitive groundwork for cardinality.
- **The Story of Numbers (Conceptual Number Construction)**:
    - **The Idea of "Next" (Successor)**: Instead of formal Peano axioms, convey the _spirit_: every number has a "next" number. This can be done through counting sequences, building towers block by block ("this block comes after that one"), or story narratives of iterative processes.
    - **"Nothingness" as a Starting Point (Zero)**: Introduce zero not just as a placeholder but as representing "no objects" in a collection.
    - **Uniqueness of Numbers**: Each number in a sequence is distinct and has a unique position.
    - **From Counting to Quantity**: Connecting the ordered sequence of number names/symbols to the size (cardinality) of sets.

**Goal**: To establish an early understanding of mathematics as a system of logical thought and structured ideas, rather than merely a set of arithmetic rules. Children should begin to see patterns and reasons behind mathematical concepts.
