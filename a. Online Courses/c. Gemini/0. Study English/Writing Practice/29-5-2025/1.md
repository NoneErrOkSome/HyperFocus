Okay, let's break this down. I'll first address your request to check the grammar of your sentences with detailed explanations, and then I'll provide the Thai text for the daily routine in a more narrative style.

**Grammatical Check of Your Request Line**

Here's your request again:

> "for simple daily routine. Just write in Thai text like a person is telling somebody about their routine. (Also, please check if this line is correct. Also give me the reason why it is correct in grammatically point don't just update or improve the words because even though it is correct but I don't understand why it's corrected)"

Let's go through it part by part:

1. **"for simple daily routine."**
    
    - **Grammatical Issue:** This is a **sentence fragment**.
    - **Reason Why:** A complete sentence needs to express a full thought and typically has a subject (who or what is doing the action) and a main verb (the action). This phrase starts with the preposition "for" and is followed by a noun phrase ("simple daily routine"). It doesn't have a main verb connected to a subject performing an action. It sets up a topic but doesn't make a complete statement or command on its own.
    - **Example of a complete sentence:** "For a simple daily routine, **please provide** some Thai text." (Here, "please provide" is the main verb phrase, and "you" is the implied subject of the command).
2. **"Just write in Thai text like a person is telling somebody about their routine."**
    
    - **"Just write in Thai text"**:
        - The command "Just write" is grammatically correct.
        - "in Thai text": While understandable, "write in Thai" is more natural and concise. "Thai" already implies the language/text. Adding "text" is slightly redundant but not strictly incorrect grammatically.
    - **"like a person is telling somebody about their routine."**:
        - This part is grammatically correct.
        - "like" acts as a conjunction, meaning "as if" or "in the same way that."
        - "a person is telling somebody about their routine" is a complete clause:
            - Subject: "a person"
            - Verb: "is telling" (present continuous tense, correctly describing an ongoing or typical action in this context of "how they would tell it")
            - Indirect Object: "somebody"
            - Object of preposition "about": "their routine" ("their" correctly refers to "a person").
    - **Overall for this sentence:** It's a grammatically sound command, with only a minor point about the naturalness of "in Thai text" versus "in Thai."


3. **"(Also, please check if this line is correct. Also give me the reason why it is correct in grammatically point don't just update or improve the words because even though it is correct but I don't understand why it's corrected)"**
    
    - This is a series of requests within parentheses.
    - **"Also, please check if this line is correct."**
        - This is grammatically correct. "if this line is correct" is a subordinate clause functioning as the object of "check."
    - **"Also give me the reason why it is correct"**
        - This part is grammatically correct. "why it is correct" is a noun clause explaining what kind of reason.
    - **"in grammatically point"**
        - **Grammatical Issue:** This phrase is incorrect.
        - **Reason Why:** "Grammatically" is an adverb (describes how an action is done or modifies an adjective/verb). "Point" is a noun. An adverb cannot directly modify a noun in this way.
        - **Corrected phrasing would be:** "from a **grammatical point** of view," "regarding the **grammatical point(s)**," or simply explain "grammatically." For example, "...the reason why it is correct grammatically."
    - **"don't just update or improve the words"**
        - This is a grammatically correct negative command.
    - **"because even though it is correct but I don't understand why it's corrected"**
        - **"because"**: Correctly introduces a reason.
        - **"even though it is correct"**: This clause is correct.
        - **"but I don't understand why it's corrected"**:
            - Using "but" after "even though" (or "although") is often considered redundant in formal English because "even though" already signals a contrast. However, it's common in spoken language.
            - "why it's corrected": The contraction "it's" means "it is" or "it has." If you mean why a specific thing _is now correct after a change_, that's fine. If you mean "I don't understand why the correct version _is_ the correct one," then "why it is correct" is better. If you're referring to a past action of correction, "why it _was_ corrected" might be what you mean. Given the context, "I don't understand why it _is_ correct" or "why certain corrections are made" seems to be the intent.

Summary of your request's grammar:

Your core instructions are clear. The main grammatical issues are the sentence fragment at the beginning and the phrase "in grammatically point." The redundancy of "but" with "even though" is more of a stylistic point for formal writing.
