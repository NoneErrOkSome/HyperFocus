This is a great effort in translating the Thai daily routine! You've conveyed the meaning well, and now we can refine the English to make it even more natural and grammatically precise.

As per our "Standing Instruction: Comprehensive English Correction," here's the corrected version of your translation, followed by detailed explanations:

**Corrected English Translation:**

"Every day, I wake up at half past six (or six-thirty). First, I go to the bathroom (or the toilet), wash my face, and brush my teeth.

After that, I have breakfast. Normally, I have bread and milk; sometimes I have rice porridge.

After I finish my breakfast, I get dressed and leave for school. I walk to school because my home is near the school (or I live near the school).

I study until noon (or twelve o'clock). When I get home in the afternoon, I take a short break. Sometimes, I help my mother with housework (or do some chores).

In the evening, after I finish my homework, I like to read (or reading) storybooks, or sometimes I watch television with my family.

I go to bed around nine o'clock so that I can wake up early in the morning, feeling refreshed (optional addition for completeness)."

**Detailed Corrections and Explanations:**

Let's go through your original translation section by section:

Original 1: "Everyday, I wake up at half past six. First, I go to toilet, wash my face and brush my teeth."

Corrected 1: "Every day, I wake up at half past six. First, I go to the bathroom (or the toilet), wash my face, and brush my teeth."

- **"Everyday,"** vs. **"Every day,"**
    - **Error:** Using the adjective form instead of the adverbial phrase.
    - **Explanation:** "Everyday" (one word) is an adjective meaning 'ordinary' or 'commonplace' (e.g., "my everyday routine"). For routines indicating "each day," you need the two-word adverbial phrase "Every day."
    - **Punctuation:** A comma is generally used after an introductory phrase like "Every day."
- **"go to toilet"** vs. **"go to the bathroom / the toilet"**
    - **Error:** Missing article "the."
    - **Explanation:** When referring to the room or fixture, "toilet" and "bathroom" usually require an article. "Bathroom" is common in US English; "the toilet" can be used (more common in UK English). The Thai "ห้องน้ำ" (hòhng náam) means "bathroom."

Original 2: "After that, I'll have breakfast. Normally, I'll have bread and milk, sometime rice porridge."

Corrected 2: "After that, I have breakfast. Normally, I have bread and milk; sometimes I have rice porridge."

- **"I'll have breakfast"** vs. **"I have breakfast"** (applies twice)
    - **Error:** Incorrect verb tense for routines.
    - **Explanation:** "I'll have" ("I will have") is future tense. Daily routines are described using the **simple present tense** (e.g., "I have," "I eat") to show habitual actions. The Thai text uses verbs in a way that indicates regular, present actions.
- **"sometime rice porridge"** vs. "**sometimes I have** rice porridge"
    - **Error:** Incorrect adverb form and missing verb.
    - **Explanation:** "Sometime" (one word, no 's') means 'at an unspecified point in time.' The correct adverb for 'occasionally' is "sometimes" (with an 's'), matching the Thai "บางที" (baang tee). It's also more complete to include the verb (e.g., "sometimes I have...").

Original 3: "Once I am done with my breakfast. I dress up and leave for school. I walk to school because I live near school."

Corrected 3: "After I finish my breakfast, I get dressed and leave for school. I walk to school because my home is near the school (or I live near the school)."

- **"Once I am done with my breakfast."** (followed by a new sentence)
    - **Error:** This is a sentence fragment if it ends with a period. "Once..." or "After..." clauses are dependent and should be connected to a main clause, usually with a comma.
    - **Explanation:** The Thai "หลังกินข้าวเช้าเสร็จ" (lǎng gin kâao cháo sèt – "after eating breakfast finished") introduces the next action. In English, "After I finish my breakfast," (with a comma) smoothly leads into the main clause.
- **"I dress up"** vs. **"I get dressed"**
    - **Error:** Word choice (nuance of phrasal verb).
    - **Explanation:** "Dress up" usually means to wear special or formal clothes. For putting on regular daily clothes, "get dressed" is the standard term, matching the Thai "แต่งตัว" (dtàeng dtua).
- **"because I live near school."** vs. **"because my home is near the school." / "because I live near the school."**
    - **Error:** Natural phrasing and article use.
    - **Explanation:** The Thai "เพราะโรงเรียนอยู่ใกล้บ้าน" (prór roong-rian yoòo glâi bâan – "because school is near home") is specific. "My home is near the school" or "I live near the school" (using "the" to specify the particular school) sounds more natural.

Original 4: "I study until twelve o'clock. When I arrived home in the afternoon, I take a little break. Sometime, I help my mother to do house cleaning."

Corrected 4: "I study until noon (or twelve o'clock). When I get home in the afternoon, I take a short break. Sometimes, I help my mother with housework (or do some chores)."

- **"When I arrived home"** vs. **"When I get home" / "When I arrive home"**
    - **Error:** Incorrect verb tense for routines.
    - **Explanation:** As this is part of a routine, the simple present tense ("get" or "arrive") is needed, not the past tense "arrived."
- **"I take a little break."** vs. **"I take a short break." / "I rest a little."**
    - **Correction:** "A little break" is understandable. "A short break" is a common collocation. "พักผ่อนนิดหน่อย" (pák-pòn nít nòi) directly translates to "rest a little."
- **"Sometime,"** vs. **"Sometimes,"**
    - **Error:** Incorrect adverb form (repeated from point 2).
    - **Explanation:** Use "sometimes" (with an 's') for 'occasionally.'
- **"help my mother to do house cleaning"** vs. **"help my mother with housework / do some chores"**
    - **Error:** Awkward phrasing.
    - **Explanation:** "House cleaning" is specific. "Housework" (Thai: "งานบ้าน" - ngaan bâan) is a general term for chores around the house. The phrase "ช่วยแม่ทำงานบ้านเล็กๆ น้อยๆ" (chûay mâe tam ngaan bâan lék lék nói nói) means helping with "small household tasks." "Help someone with something" or "help someone do something" are more natural structures.

Original 5: "In evening, after I finished my homework. I like reading storybooks or I watch television with my family."

Corrected 5: "In the evening, after I finish my homework, I like to read (or reading) storybooks, or sometimes I watch television with my family."

- **"In evening,"** vs. **"In the evening,"**
    - **Error:** Missing article "the."
    - **Explanation:** Standard phrases referring to parts of the day often use "the" (e.g., "in the morning," "in the afternoon," "in the evening").
- **"after I finished my homework."** (followed by a new sentence)
    - **Error:** Sentence fragment and incorrect verb tense (similar to point 3).
    - **Explanation:** This is a dependent clause and should be connected to the main clause with a comma. Also, use simple present "finish" for routines, not past tense "finished."
- **"I like reading storybooks or I watch..."** vs. **"I like to read/reading storybooks, or sometimes I watch..."**
    - **Note on "like reading/to read":** Both "like reading" (gerund) and "like to read" (infinitive) are correct and commonly used.
    - **Missing "sometimes":** The Thai "หรือบางทีก็ดูโทรทัศน์" (rěu baang tee gôr doo toh-rá-tát) includes "บางที" (baang tee - sometimes). Adding "sometimes" in the English version makes it a more complete translation of that part.
    - **Punctuation:** A comma before "or" is appropriate when it joins two independent clauses.

Original 6: "I go to bed around at nine o'clock to be able wake up early in the morning."

Corrected 6: "I go to bed around nine o'clock so that I can wake up early in the morning, feeling refreshed (optional)."

- **"around at nine o'clock"** vs. **"around nine o'clock"**
    - **Error:** Redundant preposition.
    - **Explanation:** Use either "around" (approximately) or "at" (specific time), but not both together like this. Thai: "ประมาณสามทุ่ม" (bprà-maan sǎam tûm - "around 9 PM").
- **"to be able wake up"** vs. **"so that I can wake up" / "to be able to wake up"**
    - **Error:** Incorrect infinitive/purpose clause structure.
    - **Explanation:** The structure "to be able" requires the infinitive "to" + verb (e.g., "to be able **to** wake up"). The Thai "เพื่อจะได้" (pêuua jà dâi) expresses purpose ("so that one can" / "in order to be able to"). "So that I can wake up" is a very natural way to express this.
- **Optional addition: "feeling refreshed"**
    - **Explanation:** The Thai text ends with "เพื่อจะได้ตื่นเช้าไปโรงเรียนอย่างสดชื่น" (pêuua jà dâi dtèun cháo bpai rohng-rian yàang sòt-chêun – "...so that (I) can wake up early to go to school feeling refreshed"). "Feeling refreshed" captures "อย่างสดชื่น." This addition makes the translation more complete but can be omitted if keeping strictly to very basic Level 1 vocabulary.

This detailed correction should help you see the patterns and specific points for improvement. Your understanding of the Thai text is good, and these refinements are mostly about making the English more standard and natural-sounding. Keep up the great work!
