Okay, let's look at your question: "Which area should I improve? (correct my English every single things I wrote)"

**Corrected version of your question:**

"Which **areas** should I improve? (Please correct **every single thing** I **write** / **have written**.)"

**Explanation of Corrections:**

1. **"Which area" vs. "Which areas"**:
    
    - You're likely asking about multiple aspects or categories of English where you can improve (e.g., grammar, vocabulary, sentence structure). So, the plural **"areas"** is more appropriate. "Which area" would imply you only expect one specific area.
2. **"every single things" vs. "every single thing"**:
    
    - "Thing" should be singular here because "every single" points to each individual item, one by one.
    - **"Every single thing"** is the correct idiom.
3. **"I wrote" vs. "I write" / "I have written"**:
    
    - **"I wrote"** (simple past) refers to something you wrote at a specific point in the past. While it could refer to your previous messages in this conversation, it might sound like you're only interested in corrections for things already past.
    - **"I write"** (simple present) can imply a general request for ongoing correction of things you write in this conversation or in general.
    - **"I have written"** (present perfect) refers to things you've written up to this point, including in this conversation, and is also a good option.
    - Given the context of an ongoing learning conversation, "Please correct every single thing I **write**" (for ongoing messages) or "Please correct every single thing I **have written**" (for everything up to now) might better reflect your continuous desire for correction.

**Based on our conversation so far, here are the general areas where you could focus your English improvement:**

1. **Complete Sentences (Avoiding Fragments):**
    
    - As we discussed with "for simple daily routine.", sometimes you use phrases that aren't complete sentences. Ensure your sentences have a subject and a main verb expressing a complete thought.
2. **Correct Word Forms (Adjectives vs. Adverbs, Nouns singular/plural):**
    
    - The example "in grammatically point" showed a misuse of an adverb ("grammatically") where an adjective or different phrasing was needed to describe "point" (a noun).
    - The example "every single things" showed an issue with noun plurality. Pay attention to whether a noun should be singular or plural.
    - The "dairy" vs. "daily" is a common issue with words that sound similar but have different meanings (homophones or near-homophones). This falls under vocabulary and spelling.
3. **Natural Phrasing and Idioms:**
    
    - Phrases like "in Thai text" (instead of the more concise "in Thai") or "before the actual date start" (instead of "before the actual start date") are understandable but could be more natural. Learning common English collocations (words that often go together) and idiomatic expressions will help.
4. **Redundancy (especially in more formal contexts):**
    
    - The example of "even though... but..." showed a slight redundancy. While common in spoken English, being aware of these can help refine your writing, especially if you aim for more formal styles later.
5. **Article Usage (a/an/the):**
    
    - While not a major issue in the specific examples we dissected deeply, learners often find articles tricky. For example, "I couldn't think of daily routine" is better as "I couldn't think of **a** daily routine."

**How to improve:**

- **Practice:** Continue to write and get feedback.
- **Focused Learning:** When a specific type of error is pointed out (like sentence fragments), try to do a few exercises focused on that grammar point.
- **Reading:** Read simple English texts (relevant to your level). Notice how sentences are structured and how words are used.
- **Listen:** Listen to English being spoken to get a feel for natural rhythms and phrasing.

You're doing well by asking for specific feedback and explanations. Keep it up!
