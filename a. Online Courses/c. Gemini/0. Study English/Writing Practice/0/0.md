I have trouble thinking a daily routine. Could you be able to write in Thai than I will translate into English instead. 



Certainly! Here's a simple paragraph about a daily routine written in Thai, which you can then translate into English:

---

ทุกเช้า ฉันตื่นนอนตอนหกโมงเช้า หลังจากนั้น ฉันแปรงฟันและล้างหน้า แล้วฉันก็ทานอาหารเช้า ส่วนใหญ่ฉันทานขนมปังและดื่มกาแฟ หลังจากทานอาหารเสร็จ ฉันเตรียมตัวไปทำงาน ฉันออกจากบ้านตอนเจ็ดโมงครึ่งและขับรถไปที่ทำงาน

Once you've translated it into English, you'll have a basic paragraph that you can use to practice forming sentences and expressing simple ideas. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like help with!

I wake up at 6 o'clock every morning. After that I go to brush my teeth and wash my face than have breakfast, mostly, I eat bread and coffee. When I finished my meal. I am ready to go to work. I leave home at half past seven and drive to work. leave home at half past seven and drive to work.

check my answer pls


Your translation captures the essence of the original Thai paragraph, but there are a few areas where you can improve clarity and grammar. Here's a revised version:

---

I wake up at 6 o'clock every morning. After that, I brush my teeth and wash my face, then have breakfast. I usually eat bread and drink coffee. Once I finish my meal, I get ready to go to work. I leave home at half past seven and drive to work.

Here are some notes on the changes:

1. **Punctuation:** Added a comma after "After that" to separate introductory elements.
2. **Conjunctions:** Changed "than" to "then" for correct sequence indication.
3. **Consistency:** Used "usually" instead of "mostly" for a smoother sentence flow.
4. **Grammar:** Adjusted "When I finished my meal." to "Once I finish my meal," for tense consistency with present tense narrative.
