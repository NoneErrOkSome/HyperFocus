Okay, I'd be happy to help you check your writing and offer some critique. You've done a good job describing a basic daily routine! Let's look at the details to make it even better.

Here's your original text:

> "I wake up at 6 o'clock every morning. After that I go to brush my teeth and wash my face than have breakfast, mostly, I eat bread and coffee. When I finished my meal. I am ready to go to work. I leave home at half past seven and drive to work. leave home at half past seven and drive to work."

Here's a breakdown of my feedback, point by point:

1. **"I wake up at 6 o'clock every morning."**
    
    - **Critique:** This sentence is clear and grammatically correct. It's a good start!
    - **Suggestion:** No change needed.
2. **"After that I go to brush my teeth and wash my face than have breakfast, mostly, I eat bread and coffee."**
    
    - **Critique:**
        - **Punctuation:** After an introductory phrase like "After that," you should use a comma. So, "After that, I go..."
        - **Word Choice (Conjunction):** "than" is used for comparisons (e.g., "more than"). For sequencing actions, you should use "then." So, "...wash my face **then** have breakfast."
        - **Clarity/Flow ("mostly"):** The placement of "mostly" is a little awkward. It can be integrated more smoothly.
        - **Word Choice (Food/Drink):** We typically "drink" coffee rather than "eat" it. So, "...I eat bread and **drink** coffee" or "...I **have** bread and coffee" (where "have" covers both eating and drinking).
    - **Suggestions:**
        - "After that, I go to brush my teeth and wash my face, and **then** I have breakfast."
        - For the second part: "For breakfast, I **mostly have** bread and coffee." or "I **usually eat** bread and **drink** coffee for breakfast."
3. **"When I finished my meal."**
    
    - **Critique:**
        - **Sentence Fragment:** This is a dependent clause (it starts with "When") and cannot stand alone as a sentence. It needs to be connected to an independent clause.
        - **Verb Tense:** You're describing a routine using the simple present tense ("I wake up," "I go"). "Finished" is simple past tense. For routines, you should use the simple present: "When I **finish** my meal."
    - **Suggestions:**
        - Combine it with the next sentence: "**When I finish** my meal, I am ready to go to work."
        - Or rephrase: "**After finishing** my meal, I am ready to go to work."
4. **"I am ready to go to work."**
    
    - **Critique:** This sentence is grammatically correct and clear.
    - **Suggestion:** No change needed if connected properly to the previous thought.
5. **"I leave home at half past seven and drive to work."**
    
    - **Critique:** This sentence is grammatically correct and clear. "Half past seven" is fine.
    - **Suggestion:** No change needed.
6. **"leave home at half past seven and drive to work."**
    
    - **Critique:**
        - **Repetition:** This is an exact repetition of the previous sentence. It's redundant.
        - **Capitalization & Subject:** If it were intended as a new sentence, it would need to start with a capital letter ("Leave") and would be missing a subject ("I"). However, it's most likely an accidental repetition.
    - **Suggestion:** This sentence should be removed.

**Overall Flow and Style:**

- You're using the correct tense (simple present) for describing a routine, which is good!
- The sequence of activities is logical.
- Pay attention to comma usage after introductory phrases and when connecting ideas.
- Ensure all sentences are complete thoughts, not fragments.
- Be mindful of word choices like "than" vs. "then."

**Here's a revised version incorporating the suggestions:**

> "I wake up at 6 o'clock every morning. After that, I brush my teeth and wash my face, and then I have breakfast. For breakfast, I usually have bread and coffee. When I finish my meal, I am ready to go to work. I leave home at half past seven and drive to work."

**Alternative for the breakfast part, if you prefer to vary sentence structure:**

> "I wake up at 6 o'clock every morning. After that, I brush my teeth and wash my face. Then, I have breakfast; I mostly eat bread and drink coffee. Once I finish my meal, I am ready to go to work. I leave home at half past seven and drive to work."

Keep practicing! Writing about your daily routine is a great way to build your English skills. You're on the right track!
