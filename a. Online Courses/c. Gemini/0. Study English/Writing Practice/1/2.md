Certainly! Let's dive deeper into why the phrase **"When I finished my meal."** needs clarification and correction, especially in the context of your daily routine.

Your original sentence was:

> "When I finished my meal."

Here are the two main points we discussed, explained further:

**1. It's a Sentence Fragment (An Incomplete Thought)**

- **What it is:** A sentence fragment is a group of words that looks like a sentence (it might start with a capital letter and end with a period), but it doesn't express a complete thought. It's like a puzzle piece that's missing other pieces to show the full picture.
    
- **Why "When I finished my meal." is a fragment:**
    
    - The word **"When"** at the beginning is a subordinating conjunction. Words like "when," "because," "if," "although," "after," "before," "while," etc., make a clause (a group of words with a subject and a verb) **dependent**.
    - A **dependent clause** cannot stand alone as a sentence. It _depends_ on an **independent clause** (a clause that _can_ stand alone as a sentence) to complete its meaning.
    - When someone reads or hears "When I finished my meal...", their natural next question is, "...what happened then?" or "...what did you do?" The thought is incomplete.
- **How to fix it:** You need to connect it to an independent clause that tells what happens when you finish your meal.
    
    - **Dependent clause:** "When I finish my meal,"
    - **Independent clause (your next thought):** "I am ready to go to work."
    - **Combined into a complete sentence:** "When I finish my meal, I am ready to go to work."
        - Now, it's a full thought: The action of being ready for work happens at the time you finish your meal.

**2. Verb Tense (Using "finish" instead of "finished" for routines)**

- **Your routine is in the Present Tense:** You started your description with "I **wake** up...", "I **go**...", which is the **simple present tense**. This tense is used for:
    - Habits
    - Daily routines
    - Things that are generally true
- **"Finished" is Past Tense:** The word "finished" is in the **simple past tense**. This tense is used for actions that started and ended at a specific time in the past (e.g., "Yesterday, I **finished** my book.").
- **Consistency in Routines:** When describing a daily routine, all the actions that are part of that routine should generally be in the simple present tense to show they happen regularly.
    - So, if waking up is "I wake up" (present), then finishing your meal as part of that same routine should be "When I **finish** my meal" (present).
    - Using "When I finished my meal" in the middle of a present tense routine description makes it sound like you're suddenly talking about one specific meal in the past, rather than what you do every day.

**Example of the Tense Issue:**

- **Sounds like a routine (correct):** "I **wake** up. I **brush** my teeth. When I **finish** breakfast, I **go** to work." (All present tense)
- **Sounds confusing (incorrect for routine):** "I **wake** up. I **brush** my teeth. When I **finished** breakfast, I **go** to work." (Mixing past "finished" with present "go" for the same routine is jarring).

**In summary for "When I finished my meal.":**

- **It's incomplete:** The word "When" makes it need more information to be a full sentence.
- **The tense is inconsistent for a routine:** "finished" (past) doesn't match the present tense used for other routine actions.

**The correction addresses both:**

> "**When I finish** my meal, I am ready to go to work."

- It's now a complete sentence by joining the dependent clause ("When I finish my meal,") with an independent clause ("I am ready to go to work.").
- The verb "finish" is now in the simple present tense, consistent with describing a daily routine.

I hope this detailed explanation helps you understand it better!
