Okay, let's explore **English Future Tenses** in as much detail as possible.

Unlike some languages that have a single verb ending for the future, English uses several different structures to talk about events, actions, or states that will happen _after_ the present moment. Each structure has its own nuances and is used in specific contexts.

Here are the main ways we express the future in English:

1. **Future Simple (using "will" and "shall")**
2. **"Be going to" structure**
3. **Present Continuous (for future arrangements)**
4. **Present Simple (for scheduled future events)**
5. **Future Continuous (Future Progressive)**
6. **Future Perfect Simple (Future Perfect)**
7. **Future Perfect Continuous (Future Perfect Progressive)**

Let's break each one down:

---
