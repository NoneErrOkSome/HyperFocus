Okay, based on the "Basic Grammar.pdf" file you provided, let's explore all about **Pronouns (คำสรรพนาม)**.

In simple terms, your file explains that a pronoun is a word used to **take the place of a noun**. The main reason for using them is to avoid repeating the same nouns over and over again, which makes sentences flow more smoothly.

The file details several types, starting with a helpful table:

1. Personal Pronouns (บุรุษสรรพนาม)
    
    These pronouns refer to specific people or things. They change form depending on their role in the sentence (subject or object) and who they are referring to (1st, 2nd, or 3rd person).
    
    - **Subject Pronouns** (ทำหน้าที่เป็นประธาน - act as the subject): These are the "doers" of the action in a sentence.
        
        - _Examples listed:_ I, we, you, they, he, she, it.
            
        - _Usage example from the file:_ "**She** is playing badminton with John."
            
    - **Object Pronouns** (ทำหน้าที่เป็นกรรม - act as the object): These pronouns receive the action of the verb or are the object of a preposition.
        
        - _Examples listed:_ me, us, you, them, him, her, it.
            
        - _Usage example from the file:_ "We will meet **you** at the library at 10 a.m."
            
2. **Possessive Adjectives vs. Possessive Pronouns (คำคุณศัพท์แสดงความเป็นเจ้าของ vs. คำสรรพนามแสดงความเป็นเจ้าของ)**
    
    - **Possessive Adjectives** (from the table, used to show ownership but _followed by a noun_): my, our, your, his, her, its, their.
        
        - _Usage example from the file (concept implied by comparison):_ "This is **her** computer."
            
    - **Possessive Pronouns** (show ownership and _stand alone_, meaning no noun follows them).
        
        - _Examples listed:_ mine, ours, yours, his, hers, its, theirs.
            
        - _Usage example from the file:_ "This computer is **hers**."
            
3. Reflexive Pronouns (คำสรรพนามสะท้อนกลับ)
    
    These pronouns "reflect" the action of the verb back to the subject. They are used when the subject performs an action on itself and end in "-self" (for singular) or "-selves" (for plural).
    
    - _Examples listed:_ myself, ourselves, yourself/yourselves, himself, herself, itself, themselves.
        
    - _Usage example from the file:_ "He needs to help **himself**."
        

Beyond the pronouns in the initial table, the file describes other categories:

4. Definite Pronouns (คำสรรพนามที่ใช้ชี้เฉพาะ)
    
    These pronouns point to specific people or things.
    
    - **Singular forms include:** this, that, such, the other, one.
        
    - **Plural forms include:** these, those, the others, ones.
        
    - _Usage example from the file:_ "**These** are good pens. **This one** is the best."
        
5. Indefinite Pronouns (คำสรรพนามที่ไม่ชี้เฉพาะ)
    
    These are used to refer to people or things in a general way, without specifying exactly who or what they are.
    
    - **Singular forms include:** another, each, either, everybody, someone, anything, nothing, no one, much, little, other.
        
    - **Plural forms include:** both, few, many, others, several.
        
    - **Forms that can be singular or plural include:** all, any, more, most, none, some, such.
        
    - _Usage example from the file:_ "There isn't **anybody** in the house."
        
6. Interrogative Pronouns (คำสรรพนามที่ใช้เป็นคำถาม)
    
    As their name suggests, these pronouns are used to ask questions.
    
    - _Examples listed:_ who, what, when, where, why, whom, whose, which, how.
        
    - _Usage example from the file:_ "**Who** always comes late?"
        
7. Relative Pronouns (คำสรรพนามที่ใช้เชื่อมความ)
    
    These pronouns connect a dependent clause (a relative clause) to a main clause by referring to a noun that has already been mentioned in the main clause. They effectively add more information about that noun.
    
    - **Referring to people:**
        - As a subject: `who` / `that`.
            
            - _Example:_ "He is the man **who** came here."
                
        - As an object: `who(m)` / `that`.
            
            - _Example:_ "He is the man **who** my sister loves."
                
        - Showing possession: `whose`.
            
            - _Example:_ "He is the man **whose** house is big."
                
    - **Referring to things (not people):**
        - As a subject: `which` / `that`.
            
            - _Example:_ "I want a book **which** has pictures."
                
        - As an object: `which` / `that`.
            
            - _Example:_ "I want a book **which** she bought."
                
        - Showing possession: `whose` / `of which`.
            
            - _Example:_ "I want a book **whose** cover is red."
                
    - **Referring to other concepts:**
        - For time: `when` / preposition + `which`.
            
            - _Example:_ "We remember the day **when** Susan first arrived."
                
        - For place: `where` / preposition + `which`.
            
            - _Example:_ "This is the restaurant **where** my brother works."
                
        - For reason: `why`.
            
            - _Example:_ "I know the reason **why** he was angry."
