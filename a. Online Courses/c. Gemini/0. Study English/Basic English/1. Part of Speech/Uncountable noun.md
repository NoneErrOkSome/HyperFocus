An **uncountable noun**, also known as a **mass noun** or **noncount noun**, refers to things that cannot be counted individually.1 They represent substances, concepts, or categories that are thought of as a whole or a mass, rather than separate, distinct units.2

Here are the key characteristics and rules for uncountable nouns:

1. Cannot be counted with numbers:

* You cannot say "one water," "two informations," or "three furnitures."3

2. Do not have a plural form:

* Uncountable nouns almost never take an "-s" to form a plural. You wouldn't say "breads" or "advices."4

3. Always take a singular verb:

* Even though they represent a "mass," they are grammatically treated as singular.5

* Correct: "The information is helpful."6 (Not "The information are helpful.")

* Correct: "The water was cold."7 (Not "The water were cold.")

4. Cannot be used with indefinite articles ("a" or "an"):

* Since you can't have "one" of them, you can't use "a" or "an."8

* Incorrect: "I need an advice."

* Correct: "I need some advice." or "I need a piece of advice."

5. Can be quantified using specific expressions or "partitives":

* To express a quantity, you use words or phrases that refer to portions, containers, or types of the uncountable noun.9

* A piece of advice

* A loaf of bread

* A glass of water

* A sheet of paper

* A grain of rice10

* Some information

* Much knowledge11

* A lot of furniture12
