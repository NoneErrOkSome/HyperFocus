A proper noun is a noun that identifies a single entity and is used to name a specific person, place, organization, or thing. In English, proper nouns are always capitalized.

Here are some examples:

- **People:** John, Mary, Dr. Smith, Queen Elizabeth
- **Places:** London, Mount Everest, France, Asia, Central Park
- **Organizations:** United Nations, Google, Red Cross, Harvard University
- **Days of the week/Months:** Monday, July, Christmas
- **Historical events:** World War II, the Renaissance
- **Specific brand names:** Coca-Cola, Nike, iPhone

In contrast, a common noun refers to a general class of people, places, things, or ideas (e.g., city, dog, book, happiness).
