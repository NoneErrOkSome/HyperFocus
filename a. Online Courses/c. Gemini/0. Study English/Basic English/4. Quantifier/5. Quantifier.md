**What are Quantifiers?**

Quantifiers are words or phrases that we put before a noun to tell us about its amount or quantity. They help specify how much or how many of something we're talking about. Your document emphasizes paying attention to what type of noun (countable or uncountable) each quantifier is used with and understanding the subtle differences between similar quantifiers.

Let's look at the specific quantifiers detailed in your file:

1. **Some / Any**
    
    - **Some**:
        - Usually used with plural countable nouns or uncountable nouns in positive (affirmative) statements, meaning "a certain amount" or "a bit" (มีบ้าง).
            
            - _Example:_ "The teacher bought **some** books."
                
        - Can be used in questions when you're offering or requesting something and generally expect the answer to be "yes".
            
            - _Example:_ "Would you like **some** coffee?"
                
    - **Any**:
        - Typically used with plural countable nouns or uncountable nouns in questions or negative statements.
            
            - _Example:_ "I do not have **any** pencils."
                
        - Can also be used in positive statements to mean "it doesn't matter which" or "whichever one" (อันไหนก็ได้).
            
            - _Example:_ "I can see you **any** time on Monday."
                
2. A few / Few & A little / Little
    
    These show small quantities, but with an important difference in meaning:
    
    - **A few**:
        - Used with plural countable nouns and means "a small number, some" (พอมีบ้าง). It has a positive feel, indicating that there are some.
            
            - _Example:_ "John bought **a few** flowers for her birthday."
                
    - **Few**:
        - Used with plural countable nouns and means "not many, hardly any" (น้อยหรือแทบไม่มีเลย). It has a more negative feel, emphasizing the lack.
            
            - _Example:_ "**Few** people visited him in hospital."
                
    - **A little**:
        - Used with uncountable nouns and means "a small amount, some" (พอมีบ้าง). It has a positive feel.
            
            - _Example:_ "Susan has **a little** salt to cook food."
                
    - **Little**:
        - Used with uncountable nouns and means "not much, hardly any" (น้อยหรือแทบไม่มีเลย). It has a more negative feel.
            
            - _Example:_ "He has very **little** money."
                
3. Many / Much
    
    Both mean "a large quantity" (มาก), but are used with different types of nouns:
    
    - **Many**: Used with plural countable nouns.
        
        - _Example:_ "He did not make **many** mistakes."
            
    - **Much**: Used with uncountable nouns.
        
        - _Example:_ "Have you got **much** time?"
            
4. Each / Every
    
    These refer to individual items within a group and are followed by a singular countable noun and a singular verb.
    
    - **Each** (แต่ละ - each one): Focuses on individual members of a group separately.
        
        - _Example:_ "**Each** student wants to pass the examination."
            
        - When used as `each of`, it's followed by a plural countable noun, but still usually takes a singular verb.
            
            - _Example:_ "He asked **each of** the students to speak English."
                
    - **Every** (ทุกๆ - all members of a group considered individually): Refers to all members of a group as a whole, but still emphasizing them individually.
