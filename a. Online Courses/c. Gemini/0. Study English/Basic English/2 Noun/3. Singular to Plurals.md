Okay, forming plurals in English has a set of rules, though like many things in English, there are exceptions! Here's a detailed breakdown of how singular nouns generally become plural:

1. The Regular Rule: Add "-s"
    
    This is the most common way to make a noun plural.
    
    - `book` → `books`
    - `cat` → `cats`
    - `house` → `houses`
    - `apple` → `apples`
    - `day` → `days`
    - `idea` → `ideas`
2. Nouns Ending in -s, -ss, -sh, -ch, -x, or -z: Add "-es"
    
    When a noun ends with these hissing or buzzing sounds, adding just an "-s" would make it hard to pronounce, so "-es" is added (which usually adds an extra syllable).
    
    - `bus` → `buses`
    - `kiss` → `kisses`
    - `dish` → `dishes`
    - `church` → `churches`
    - `box` → `boxes`
    - `buzz` → `buzzes`
    - `waltz` → `waltzes`
3. **Nouns Ending in Consonant + -y: Change "-y" to "-i" and Add "-es"**
    
    - `baby` → `babies`
    - `city` → `cities`
    - `story` → `stories`
    - `party` → `parties`
    - `country` → `countries`
    - `fly` → `flies` (the insect)
4. Nouns Ending in Vowel + -y: Add "-s"
    
    If the "y" is preceded by a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), you just add "-s".
    
    - `boy` → `boys`
    - `key` → `keys`
    - `toy` → `toys`
    - `day` → `days` (already covered in rule 1, but fits this pattern too)
    - `valley` → `valleys`
5. Nouns Ending in -o:
    
    This category is a bit mixed.
    
    - **Usually, nouns ending in a consonant + -o add "-es":**
        - `potato` → `potatoes`
        - `tomato` → `tomatoes`
        - `hero` → `heroes`
        - `echo` → `echoes`
        - `volcano` → `volcanoes` (though "volcanos" is also seen)
    - **Nouns ending in a vowel + -o, or musical terms/words of foreign origin, often just add "-s":**
        - `radio` → `radios`
        - `studio` → `studios`
        - `zoo` → `zoos`
        - `piano` → `pianos`
        - `photo` (short for photograph) → `photos`
        - `kangaroo` → `kangaroos`
        - `video` → `videos`
    - **Some can take either "-s" or "-es" (check a dictionary if unsure):**
        - `mosquito` → `mosquitos` or `mosquitoes`
        - `zero` → `zeros` or `zeroes`
        - `motto` → `mottos` or `mottoes`
6. Nouns Ending in -f or -fe:
    
    This is another mixed category.
    
    - **Many nouns ending in -f or -fe change the -f or -fe to "-ves":**
        - `leaf` → `leaves`
        - `wife` → `wives`
        - `knife` → `knives`
        - `wolf` → `wolves`
        - `life` → `lives`
        - `self` → `selves`
        - `shelf` → `shelves`
        - `thief` → `thieves`
    - **Some nouns ending in -f or -fe just add "-s":**
        - `roof` → `roofs`
        - `chief` → `chiefs`
        - `belief` → `beliefs`
        - `safe` → `safes` (the noun for a secure box)
        - `chef` → `chefs`
        - `cliff` → `cliffs`
    - **A few can do either (check a dictionary):**
        - `dwarf` → `dwarfs` or `dwarves`
        - `scarf` → `scarfs` or `scarves`
        - `hoof` → `hoofs` or `hooves`
7. Irregular Plurals:
    
    These nouns don't follow any of the standard rules and their plurals must be memorized.
    
    - **Vowel changes:**
        - `man` → `men`
        - `woman` → `women` (pronunciation changes significantly too)
        - `foot` → `feet`
        - `tooth` → `teeth`
        - `goose` → `geese`
        - `mouse` → `mice`
        - `louse` → `lice`
    - **"-en" ending:**
        - `child` → `children`
        - `ox` → `oxen`
    - **No change (singular and plural forms are the same):**
        - `sheep` → `sheep`
        - `deer` → `deer`
        - `fish` → `fish` (often, but "fishes" can be used to refer to multiple species of fish)
        - `series` → `series`
        - `species` → `species`
        - `aircraft` → `aircraft`
        - `spacecraft` → `spacecraft`
        - `moose` → `moose`
        - `salmon` → `salmon`
    - **Different word entirely:**
        - `person` → `people` (though "persons" is used in very formal or legal contexts)
8. Nouns from Latin or Greek Origins:
    
    Many English nouns borrowed from Latin or Greek retain their original plural forms, although some also have anglicized plurals (ending in "-s" or "-es").
    
    - `-us` → `-i`:
        - `cactus` → `cacti` (or `cactuses`)
        - `fungus` → `fungi` (or `funguses`)
        - `stimulus` → `stimuli`
        - `alumnus` (male graduate) → `alumni`
    - `-a` → `-ae`:
        - `antenna` → `antennae` (insect feelers) (or `antennas` for radio/TV aerials)
        - `larva` → `larvae`
        - `alumna` (female graduate) → `alumnae`
    - `-um` → `-a`:
        - `datum` → `data` (often treated as plural, sometimes as uncountable singular)
        - `medium` → `media` (or `mediums` for spiritualists)
        - `curriculum` → `curricula` (or `curriculums`)
        - `bacterium` → `bacteria`
        - `memorandum` → `memoranda` (or `memorandums`)
    - `-is` → `-es` (pronounced /iːz/):
        - `analysis` → `analyses`
        - `crisis` → `crises`
        - `thesis` → `theses`
        - `axis` → `axes`
        - `oasis` → `oases`
    - `-on` → `-a`:
        - `criterion` → `criteria`
        - `phenomenon` → `phenomena`
    - `-ix` / `-ex` → `-ices` (or anglicized "-exes"):
        - `appendix` → `appendices` (or `appendixes`)
        - `index` → `indices` (or `indexes`)
        - `matrix` → `matrices` (or `matrixes`)
9. Compound Nouns:
    
    The way to make a compound noun plural depends on its structure.
    
    - **Usually, the most significant word (often the last word if it's a noun + noun combination, or the main noun part) is made plural:**
        - `bookshelf` → `bookshelves`
        - `policeman` → `policemen`
        - `passerby` → `passersby`
        - `mother-in-law` → `mothers-in-law`
        - `attorney general` → `attorneys general`
        - `cupful` → `cupfuls` (the "ful" part is considered the end of the word here)
        - `high school` → `high schools`
    - **If the compound noun is written as one word without a clear main noun, or if it refers to a type of person, the "-s" is usually added at the end:**
        - `grown-up` → `grown-ups`
        - `forget-me-not` → `forget-me-nots`
        - `takeaway` -> `takeaways`
10. **Letters, Numbers, and Symbols:**
    
    - Often pluralized by adding an apostrophe + s (though this is becoming less common, especially for decades). Adding just -s is also widely accepted.
        - "Mind your p's and q's."
        - "There are two A's (or As) in 'aardvark'."
        - "The 1990s" (preferred over "the 1990's").

It's a lot to take in, but the first two rules (adding "-s" and "-es") cover the vast majority of nouns. For the others, exposure, practice, and occasionally checking a dictionary are your best friends!
