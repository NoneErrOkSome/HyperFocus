Subject-verb agreement is a fundamental concept in English grammar that dictates that the verb in a sentence must agree in number (singular or plural) with its subject. This means that if the subject is singular, the verb must also be singular, and if the subject is plural, the verb must be plural.1 While the basic principle seems straightforward, numerous complexities and exceptions can make subject-verb agreement challenging to master.

Let's delve into the intricacies of subject-verb agreement, exploring its core principles, common pitfalls, and specific rules for various sentence structures.

### The Core Principle: Singular Subjects, Singular Verbs; Plural Subjects, Plural Verbs

At its heart, subject-verb agreement is about matching the form of the verb to the number of the subject.

- **Singular Subject + Singular Verb:** A singular subject refers to one person, place, thing, or idea. The singular form of a verb often ends in "-s" or "-es" in the present tense (e.g., _walks, runs, sees, goes_).
    
    - _Example:_ The **dog runs** across the yard. (Singular subject "dog," singular verb "runs")
    - _Example:_ **She is** a talented artist. (Singular subject "she," singular verb "is")
- **Plural Subject + Plural Verb:** A plural subject refers to more than one person, place, thing, or idea. The plural form of a verb in the present tense typically does not end in "-s" or "-es" (e.g., _walk, run, see, go_).
    
    - _Example:_ The **dogs run** across the yard. (Plural subject "dogs," plural verb "run")
    - _Example:_ **They are** talented artists. (Plural subject "they," plural verb "are")

### Identifying the True Subject

One of the most common challenges in subject-verb agreement is correctly identifying the true subject of a sentence, especially when there are intervening phrases or clauses.

#### 1. Prepositional Phrases Between Subject and Verb

Prepositional phrases (e.g., _of the books, in the box, with her friends_) often appear between the subject and the verb. **Crucially, the subject is never part of a prepositional phrase.** Ignore these phrases when determining the subject-verb agreement.

- _Incorrect:_ The **box of chocolates are** delicious.
    
- _Correct:_ The **box** (of chocolates) **is** delicious. (The subject is "box," not "chocolates.")
    
- _Incorrect:_ The **students in the class learns** quickly.
    
- _Correct:_ The **students** (in the class) **learn** quickly. (The subject is "students," not "class.")
    

#### 2. Clauses Beginning with "Who," "Which," and "That"

When a clause beginning with "who," "which," or "that" acts as the subject of the main verb, the verb within that clause must agree with the antecedent (the noun or pronoun that "who," "which," or "that" refers to).

- _Example:_ The **student who studies** regularly performs well. (The verb "studies" agrees with "student.")
- _Example:_ The **students who study** regularly perform well. (The verb "study" agrees with "students.")

#### 3. Inverted Sentences (Beginning with "Here" or "There")

In sentences that begin with "here" or "there," the subject comes _after_ the verb. To ensure agreement, mentally rearrange the sentence to identify the true subject.

- _Incorrect:_ **There is** many reasons to celebrate.
    
- _Correct:_ **There are** many reasons to celebrate. (Reasons are, not reason is.)
    
- _Incorrect:_ **Here comes** the buses.
    
- _Correct:_ **Here come** the buses. (Buses come, not bus comes.)
    

### Special Cases and Tricky Scenarios

Beyond the basic principles, several specific grammatical constructions require particular attention for subject-verb agreement.

#### 1. Compound Subjects Joined by "And"

When two or more subjects are joined by "and," they generally form a plural subject and require a plural verb.

- _Example:_ **John and Mary are** going to the party.
    
- _Example:_ The **cat and the dog chase** each other.
    
- **Exception:** If the two subjects joined by "and" refer to a single entity or idea, they take a singular verb.
    
    - _Example:_ **Bread and butter is** a common breakfast. (Refers to one dish)
    - _Example:_ **Macaroni and cheese is** my favorite comfort food. (Refers to one dish)

#### 2. Compound Subjects Joined by "Or," "Nor," "Either...Or," "Neither...Nor"

When subjects are joined by "or," "nor," "either...or," or "neither...nor," the verb agrees with the subject **closest** to it.

- _Example:_ **Neither the students nor the teacher is** ready. (The verb "is" agrees with "teacher.")
    
- _Example:_ **Neither the teacher nor the students are** ready. (The verb "are" agrees with "students.")
    
- _Example:_ **Either my sister or my parents are** coming. (The verb "are" agrees with "parents.")
    
- _Example:_ **Either my parents or my sister is** coming. (The verb "is" agrees with "sister.")
    

#### 3. Collective Nouns

Collective nouns (e.g., _team, committee, family, audience, group_) refer to a group of individuals. Their agreement depends on whether the group is acting as a single, unified entity or as separate individuals.

- **Singular Verb (acting as a unit):**
    
    - _Example:_ The **team is** playing well together. (The team is acting as one unit.)
    - _Example:_ The **committee has** reached a decision. (The committee has made one decision.)
- **Plural Verb (acting as individuals):**
    
    - _Example:_ The **team are** arguing among themselves. (The individual members are arguing.)
    - _Example:_ The **committee are** disagreeing on the proposed changes. (The individual members are disagreeing.)
- **Note:** In American English, collective nouns are more commonly treated as singular. In British English, they are more often treated as plural when the members are acting individually.
    

#### 4. Indefinite Pronouns

Indefinite pronouns refer to nonspecific people or things. Some are always singular, some are always plural, and some can be either depending on the context.

- **Always Singular:** _anyone, anybody, anything, everyone, everybody, everything, no one, nobody, nothing, someone, somebody, something, each, either, neither, one._
    
    - _Example:_ **Everyone is** here.
    - _Example:_ **Each of the students has** completed the assignment.
    - _Example:_ **Neither of the options is** suitable.
- **Always Plural:** _both, few, many, several._
    
    - _Example:_ **Both are** correct.
    - _Example:_ **Many of the questions were** difficult.
- **Can be Singular or Plural (depending on the object of the prepositional phrase):** _all, any, none, most, some._
    
    - _Example:_ **Some of the water is** clean. (Singular, because "water" is singular)
    - _Example:_ **Some of the students are** absent. (Plural, because "students" is plural)
    - _Example:_ **None of the cake was** eaten. (Singular, because "cake" is singular)
    - _Example:_ **None of the cookies were** eaten. (Plural, because "cookies" is plural)

#### 5. Quantifiers: "A Number of" vs. "The Number of"

- **"A number of" (meaning "many") takes a plural verb.**
    
    - _Example:_ **A number of students are** waiting outside.
- **"The number of" (referring to a specific quantity) takes a singular verb.**
    
    - _Example:_ **The number of students in the class is** twenty.

#### 6. Fractions, Percentages, and Portions

When a fraction, percentage, or a word indicating a portion (e.g., _half, most, all_) refers to a singular noun, the verb is singular. If it refers to a plural noun, the verb is plural. The agreement depends on the noun following the "of" phrase.

- _Example:_ **Half of the pie was** eaten. (Singular, because "pie" is singular)
- _Example:_ **Half of the students were** absent. (Plural, because "students" is plural)
- _Example:_ **20% of the population is** unemployed. (Singular, because "population" is singular)
- _Example:_ **20% of the employees are** working from home. (Plural, because "employees" is plural)

#### 7. Titles of Books, Movies, etc.

Even if a title contains plural words, it refers to a single entity (the book, movie, etc.) and therefore takes a singular verb.

- _Example:_ _The **Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is** a classic novel._

#### 8. Subjects Expressing Periods of Time, Sums of Money, Distances, etc.

When these subjects function as a single unit, they take a singular verb.

- _Example:_ **Ten years is** a long time.
- _Example:_ **Five hundred dollars was** the prize money.
- _Example:_ **Two miles is** a short distance for him.

#### 9. "Every" and "Each" Before a Compound Subject

When "every" or "each" precedes a compound subject, the subject is considered singular, and the verb takes the singular form.

- _Example:_ **Every student and every teacher is** expected to attend.
- _Example:_ **Each boy and each girl was** given a prize.

#### 10. Parenthetical Expressions

Phrases like "as well as," "in addition to," "along with," and "together with" do not change the number of the subject. The verb agrees only with the main subject.

- _Example:_ The **manager, as well as the employees, is** attending the conference. (The subject is "manager.")
- _Example:_ The **students, along with their teacher, are** going on a field trip. (The subject is "students.")

### Verb Forms and Tenses

While the examples above primarily focus on the present tense, subject-verb agreement applies across all tenses. The key is to know the singular and plural forms of the verb in each tense.

- **Be Verbs (Am, Is, Are, Was, Were):** These are the most common verbs where agreement errors occur.
    
    - _Present:_ I **am**, You **are**, He/She/It **is**, We **are**, They **are**
    - _Past:_ I **was**, You **were**, He/She/It **was**, We **were**, They **were**
- **Have/Has:**
    
    - _Present:_ I/You/We/They **have**, He/She/It **has**
- **Do/Does:**
    
    - _Present:_ I/You/We/They **do**, He/She/It **does**
- **Other Verbs (Present Tense):**
    
    - Singular subjects: verb + -s/-es (e.g., _walks, runs, sees_)
    - Plural subjects: base form of the verb (e.g., _walk, run, see_)

### Practical Tips for Ensuring Subject-Verb Agreement

1. **Identify the Subject First:** Before you even think about the verb, pinpoint the true subject of the sentence. Cross out any intervening prepositional phrases or clauses that might distract you.
2. **Determine the Subject's Number:** Is the subject singular or plural?
3. **Choose the Corresponding Verb Form:** Select the verb form that matches the number of the subject.
4. **Read Aloud:** Sometimes, hearing the sentence aloud can help you catch agreement errors that you might miss by just reading silently.
5. **Practice, Practice, Practice:** The more you practice identifying subjects and applying the rules, the more intuitive subject-verb agreement will become.

### Conclusion

Subject-verb agreement is a cornerstone of clear and grammatically correct English. While the basic principle is straightforward, the nuances and exceptions can be challenging. By diligently identifying the true subject, understanding the rules for various sentence structures, and paying attention to collective nouns, indefinite pronouns, and other special cases, you can master this essential grammatical concept and enhance the precision and clarity of your writing. Consistent practice and a keen eye for detail are your best allies in achieving impeccable subject-verb agreement.
