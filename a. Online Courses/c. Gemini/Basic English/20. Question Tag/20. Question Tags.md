Okay, I can teach you about **Question Tags** in English, drawing from the information in the "Basic Grammar.pdf" file you provided.

In simple terms, a **question tag** is a short question that you add to the end of a statement. Think of it as a mini-question tacked onto a sentence.

**Purpose of Question Tags:**

The main reason for using a question tag, according to the file, is to ask for **confirmation** or **agreement** about what you've just said. You're usually expecting a "Yes" or "No" answer.

- _Example from the file:_ "It is cold today, **isn't it?**" (You think it's cold and are checking if the other person agrees.)
    

**Basic Formation Rules:**

The file outlines two fundamental rules for forming question tags:

1. **Positive Statement + Negative Tag:** If your main sentence is positive, the question tag is usually negative.
    - _Example from the file:_ "It **is** cold today, **isn't it?**"
        
2. **Negative Statement + Positive Tag:** If your main sentence is negative, the question tag is usually positive.
    - _Example from the file:_ "Your sister **can't** swim, **can she?**"
        

**How to Form the Tag Itself:**

The tag consists of an **auxiliary verb (or a form of "to be" or "do") + a pronoun** that refers back to the subject of the statement.

- **Verb in the Tag:**
    - If the main statement uses a form of the verb **"to be"** (am, is, are, was, were) or an **auxiliary verb** (like `will, can, have, should, must`, etc.), you use the _same verb_ in the question tag.
        
        - _Example from the file:_ "She **is** beautiful, **isn't she?**"
            
        - _Example from the file:_ "They **won't** come back, **will they?**"
            
    - If the main statement uses a main verb (and doesn't have an auxiliary verb or "to be" as the main verb), you use the appropriate form of **"do" (`do, does, did`)** in the question tag.
        
        - _Example from the file:_ "He **helped** you, **didn't he?**" (Past tense, so "did" is used)
            
        - _Example from the file:_ "Ann **loves** Jim, **doesn't she?**" (Present tense, 3rd person singular, so "does" is used)
            
- **Pronoun in the Tag:** The pronoun in the tag should match the subject of the main statement.
    
- **Contractions:** For negative tags, contractions are commonly used (e.g., `isn't, aren't, don't, doesn't, didn't, won't, can't`). The file provides a list of these common contractions.
    

**Special Cases and Exceptions (These are important for detail!):**

Your file highlights several special situations:

1. **Imperative Sentences (Commands or Requests):**
    
    - These usually take `will you?` or `won't you?` as the tag, regardless of whether the imperative is positive or negative.
        
        - _Example from the file:_ "Open the window, **will you?**"
            
        - _Example from the file:_ "Come and see me tomorrow, **will you?**"
            
        - For negative commands (Don't...), `will you?` is common: "Don't be late, **will you?**"
2. **Statements beginning with "Let's..." (Suggestions):**
    
    - These always use `shall we?` as the tag.
        
        - _Example from the file:_ "Let's go now, **shall we?**"
            
        - _Example from the file:_ "Let's play football, **shall we?**"
            
3. **Statements beginning with "Let him/us (not 'we')..." or "Let them...":**
    
    - These use `will you?` as the tag.
        
        - _Example from the file:_ "Let him come in, **will you?**"
            
        - _Example from the file:_ "Let us do it, **will you?**" (Here "us" does not mean "let's" in the sense of a suggestion for the group including the speaker and listener in the same way).
            
4. **Statements starting with "I am...":**
    
    - The negative tag for "I am" is `aren't I?`.
        
        - _Example from the file:_ "I am very lazy, **aren't I?**"
            
        - _Example from the file:_ "I am older than you, **aren't I?**"
            
5. **Statements with "used to":**
    
    - The question tag uses `did` (or `didn't`) + pronoun.
        
        - _Example from the file:_ "Your friend used to work here, **didn't he?**"
            
        - _Example from the file:_ "She used to get up very early, **didn't she?**"
            
6. **Statements with "There is/are...":**
    
    - The tag uses the verb `is/are` (or `isn't/aren't`) + `there`. "There" acts as the pronoun in the tag.
        
        - _Example from the file:_ "There is a dictionary on the desk, **isn't there?**"
            
        - _Example from the file:_ "There is nothing in that box, **is there?**" (Note: "nothing" makes the statement negative, so the tag is positive)
            
7. **Statements with Indefinite Pronouns as Subjects (e.g., `everyone, everybody, someone, somebody, anyone, anybody, no one, nobody`):**
    
    - The pronoun used in the question tag is `they`.
        
        - _Example from the file:_ "Everybody knows the answer, **don't they?**" (Even though "Everybody" takes a singular verb, the tag uses "they" and a plural verb form like "don't").
            
        - _Example from the file:_ "Someone comes here now, **don't they?**"
            
        - If the indefinite pronoun is negative (like `no one, nobody`), the statement is negative, so the tag will be positive: "Nobody called, **did they?**"

Understanding these rules and special cases will allow you to use question tags correctly to make your English sound more natural and to engage in conversations more effectively by seeking confirmation or agreement.
