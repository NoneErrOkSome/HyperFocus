Okay, I'd be happy to teach you about **Reported Speech** (also known as Indirect Speech) in English! This is how we tell someone what another person said, but _without_ using their exact words.

**1. What is Reported Speech? (vs. Direct Speech)**

- **Direct Speech:** This is when you quote the exact words someone said, usually enclosed in quotation marks (" ").
    - _Example:_ Mary said, **"I am tired."**
- **Reported Speech (Indirect Speech):** This is when you report what someone said, but you integrate it into your own sentence. You don't use quotation marks, and there are often changes to tenses, pronouns, and other words.
    - _Example:_ Mary said **that she was tired.**

**2. Why Use Reported Speech?**

We use reported speech to convey information, tell stories about past conversations, or summarize what people have said.

**3. Key Changes When Converting Direct Speech to Reported Speech:**

When you change direct speech to reported speech, several things often need to be adjusted, especially if the reporting verb (like `said`, `told`, `asked`) is in the past tense.

- **Reporting Verbs:** You'll use a reporting verb like `say`, `tell`, `ask`, `explain`, `announce`, `reply`, `wonder`, etc.
    - Note the difference: `say` doesn't need a personal object ("He **said** he was happy"). `tell` usually needs a personal object ("He **told me** he was happy").
- **No Quotation Marks:** Reported speech does not use quotation marks.
- **Conjunction "that" (for statements):** The word `that` is often used to introduce the reported statement. It can sometimes be omitted, especially in informal speech.
    - _Example:_ He said **(that)** he was ready.
- **Backshift of Tenses:** This is a crucial rule. If your reporting verb is in the past (e.g., "she **said**," "he **told me**"), the tense of the verb in the reported clause usually "shifts back" one step into the past.
    - Present Simple → **Past Simple**
        - Direct: "I **like** ice cream." → Reported: She said (that) she **liked** ice cream.
    - Present Continuous → **Past Continuous**
        - Direct: "I **am watching** TV." → Reported: He said he **was watching** TV.
    - Past Simple → **Past Perfect**
        - Direct: "I **saw** the movie." → Reported: She said she **had seen** the movie.
    - Present Perfect → **Past Perfect**
        - Direct: "I **have finished** my work." → Reported: He said he **had finished** his work.
    - Past Continuous → **Past Perfect Continuous**
        - Direct: "I **was waiting** for you." → Reported: She said she **had been waiting** for me.
    - Past Perfect → **Past Perfect** (No change further back)
        - Direct: "I **had already eaten**." → Reported: He said he **had already eaten**.
    - Future Simple (`will`) → **Conditional (`would`)**
        - Direct: "I **will** help you." → Reported: She said she **would** help me.
    - Modal Verbs:
        - `can` → `could`
        - `may` → `might`
        - `must` → `had to` (or sometimes `must` if the obligation is still relevant or a general truth)
        - `should, could, might, would, ought to` usually do **not** change.
- **Exceptions to Tense Backshift:**
    - If the **reporting verb is in the present tense** (e.g., "He says," "She tells me"), the tense in the reported clause usually does not change.
        - Direct: "I **am** busy." → Reported: He says (that) he **is** busy.
    - If the direct speech states a **general truth or fact** that is still true.
        - Direct: "The Earth **is** round." → Reported: The teacher said (that) the Earth **is** round.
    - If the direct speech describes a **situation that hasn't changed** (though backshift is also possible).
        - Direct: "My brother **lives** in London." → Reported: She said her brother **lives** (or **lived**) in London.
    - Sometimes, if you are reporting something **immediately or very recently said** and it's still true.
- **Changes in Pronouns and Possessive Adjectives:** These must change to reflect the perspective of the person reporting the speech.
    - Direct: He said, "**I** like **my** new car."
    - Reported: He said (that) **he** liked **his** new car.
    - Direct: She said to me, "**You** can use **your** phone."
    - Reported: She told me (that) **I** could use **my** phone.
- **Changes in Time and Place Expressions:** Adverbs of time and place often need to shift to match the perspective of the report.
    - `now` → `then, at that time`
    - `today` → `that day`
    - `yesterday` → `the day before, the previous day`
    - `tomorrow` → `the next day, the following day`
    - `this week/month/year` → `that week/month/year`
    - `next week/month/year` → `the following week/month/year`
    - `last week/month/year` → `the week/month/year before, the previous week/month/year`
    - `ago` → `before, previously`
    - `here` → `there`
    - `this/these` (as determiners/pronouns) → `that/those`
        - Direct: "I will do it **tomorrow**," he said.
        - Reported: He said he would do it **the next day**.
        - Direct: "I saw her **here**," she said.
        - Reported: She said she had seen her **there**.

**4. Reporting Different Types of Sentences:**

- **A. Reporting Statements:**
    
    - Use reporting verbs like `say`, `tell` (plus object), `explain`, `announce`, `mention`, `state`, etc.
    - Use the conjunction `that` (often optional).
    - Apply tense backshift, pronoun changes, and time/place changes if the reporting verb is in the past.
    - _Example:_
        - Direct: Anna said, "I am studying for my exams this week."
        - Reported: Anna said (that) she was studying for her exams that week.
- **B. Reporting Questions:**
    
    - Use reporting verbs like `ask`, `wonder`, `inquire`, `want to know`.
    - The word order in the reported question changes from question form (Verb-Subject) to statement form (Subject-Verb).
    - Do not use a question mark at the end of the reported question.
    - **Yes/No Questions:** Introduce the reported question with `if` or `whether`.
        - Direct: He asked, "Are you coming to the party?"
        - Reported: He asked **if/whether I was coming** to the party.
    - **Wh- Questions** (what, where, when, why, who, how, etc.): Use the same wh-word to introduce the reported question.
        - Direct: She asked, "Where do you live?"
        - Reported: She asked **where I lived**.
    - Tense backshift, pronoun, and time/place changes apply as usual if the reporting verb is in the past.
- **C. Reporting Commands, Requests, and Advice:**
    
    - The imperative verb (the command/request verb) in direct speech changes to an **infinitive (`to` + base verb)** or a **negative infinitive (`not to` + base verb)** in reported speech.
    - **Commands:** Use reporting verbs like `tell` (plus object), `order`, `command`.
        - Direct: The teacher said to the students, "Open your books."
        - Reported: The teacher **told/ordered** the students **to open** their books.
    - **Requests:** Use reporting verbs like `ask` (plus object), `request`, `beg`.
        - Direct: "Please help me with this," she said to Tom.
        - Reported: She **asked** Tom **to help** her with that.
    - **Negative Commands/Requests:**
        - Direct: "Don't make noise," he said to the children.
        - Reported: He **told** the children **not to make** noise.
    - **Advice:** Use reporting verbs like `advise` (plus object).
        - Direct: "You should see a doctor," my friend said to me.
        - Reported: My friend **advised me to see** a doctor. (Or: My friend said I should see a doctor.)
    - **Suggestions:** Use reporting verbs like `suggest`. This can be followed by:
        - a gerund (`-ing` form):
            - Direct: "Let's go for a walk," he said.
            - Reported: He **suggested going** for a walk.
        - `that` + subject + `(should)` + base verb:
            - Reported: He **suggested that we (should) go** for a walk.
    - Pronoun and time/place changes apply as needed.

Reported speech is a very common and important part of English communication. It might seem like there are many rules, but with practice, these changes will become more natural!
