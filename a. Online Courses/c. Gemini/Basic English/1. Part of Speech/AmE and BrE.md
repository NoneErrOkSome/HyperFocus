You've hit on one of the most interesting and often discussed grammatical differences between American English (AmE) and British English (BrE): how they treat collective nouns in terms of verb agreement.

Here's a deeper dive based on the previous examples and general rules:

**The Core Difference: Unity vs. Individual Members**

The fundamental distinction lies in whether the collective noun is viewed as:

- **A single, unified entity (AmE preference):** If the group is acting together, as one unit, AmE almost always uses a singular verb.
- **A collection of individual members (BrE preference, but also AmE when emphasizing individuals):** If the focus is on the members of the group acting separately, or if the group is seen as composed of multiple individuals, BrE often uses a plural verb. AmE can also use a plural verb in these specific contexts, but it's less common and might sometimes sound awkward, leading to rephrasing.

**Let's break it down with examples:**

**1. "The team..."**

- **American English:** Almost always singular.
    
    - "The **team is** playing well tonight." (The team as a single unit performing)
    - "The **team has** won its last five games." (The team as a single entity achieving)
    - _Possible, but less common:_ "The **team are** arguing among themselves." (Here, the focus is on individual members disagreeing, but AmE would often prefer "The **team members are** arguing...")
- **British English:** Often plural, especially when referring to performance or actions of the members.
    
    - "The **team are** playing well tonight." (Focus on the individual players performing)
    - "The **team have** won their last five games." (Focus on the players achieving)
    - "The **team are** arguing among themselves." (This is very natural and common in BrE, as it clearly emphasizes the individual members)

**2. "The family..."**

- **American English:** Typically singular, unless there's a strong emphasis on individual actions.
    
    - "My **family is** coming to visit." (The family as a unit)
    - "The **family was** gathered at the reunion." (The family as a single assembly)
    - _If emphasizing individuals:_ "The **family** (members) **are** all going in different directions." (AmE might rephrase: "The **members of the family are** all going...")
- **British English:** Can be singular or plural, depending on the nuance.
    
    - "My **family is** big." (Referring to the size of the unit)
    - "My **family are** coming to visit." (Focus on the individuals arriving)
    - "The **family are** disagreeing on the holiday plans." (Emphasizing individual disagreements)

**3. "The government / The committee / The audience / The staff..."**

These often follow similar patterns.

- **American English (singular preference):**
    
    - "The **government is** debating a new policy."
    - "The **committee meets** every Tuesday."
    - "The **audience was** captivated by the performance."
    - "The **staff is** working late tonight."
- **British English (plural often preferred, especially when the actions involve individual agency):**
    
    - "The **government are** debating a new policy."
    - "The **committee are** unable to agree."
    - "The **audience were** applauding loudly."
    - "The **staff are** complaining about the new rules."

**Important Nuances and Exceptions:**

- **Specificity of Action:** If the collective noun is doing something that _only_ individuals can do (e.g., "The committee **are arguing**," "The jury **are disagreeing**"), then even in AmE, a plural verb can sometimes be used, although it's still more common to rephrase ("The members of the committee are arguing").
- **Proper Nouns (Sports Teams, Bands):**
    - **AmE:** Sports teams and band names, even if they end in an 's' (e.g., "The Yankees"), are generally treated as singular if the team name itself is singular (e.g., "The Jazz **is** looking for a new player" â€“ though this varies among speakers, and you'll often hear "The Jazz **are** looking..."). If the name is plural in form (e.g., "The New York Yankees"), they will be plural ("The Yankees **are** playing today").
    - **BrE:** Sports teams and band names are almost universally treated as plural, regardless of whether the name is singular or plural in form. E.g., "Manchester United **are** playing at home," "Coldplay **are** releasing a new album."
- **"Police":** This is a unique collective noun that _always_ takes a plural verb in both American and British English.
    - "The **police are** investigating the crime." (Never "the police is")
- **"Data":** In formal contexts, "data" is the plural of "datum" and takes a plural verb (e.g., "The data **show**..."). However, in everyday AmE, "data" is increasingly treated as a singular mass noun (e.g., "The data **is** clear..."). BrE tends to maintain the plural usage more consistently.
- **"Majority":** Often takes a plural verb in both, especially when referring to individual members within a group. "The majority **are** in favor."

**Practical Advice:**

- **For American English speakers/writers:** When in doubt, default to a singular verb for collective nouns. If you need to emphasize the individual actions, consider rephrasing the sentence to make the subject plural (e.g., "The members of the team...")
- **For British English speakers/writers:** You have more flexibility. Choose singular if you want to emphasize the group as a single unit, and plural if you want to emphasize the individual members. The plural is often quite natural, especially for groups of people.

Understanding these nuances helps to appreciate the subtle differences that have evolved between American and British English over time!
