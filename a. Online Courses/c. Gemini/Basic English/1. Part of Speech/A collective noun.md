A **collective noun** is a noun that refers to a group of people, animals, or things as a single unit. Even though it represents multiple individuals, it's typically treated as singular in grammar, especially in American English.

Here are some common examples of collective nouns:

**For people:**

- **audience** (a group of listeners or spectators)
- **band** (a group of musicians)
- **choir** (a group of singers)
- **class** (a group of students)
- **committee** (a group of people appointed for a specific function)
- **crew** (a group of people working together, often on a ship or aircraft)
- **crowd** (a large group of people)
- **family** (a group of related people)
- **gang** (often used for a group of criminals, but can also refer to a group of friends)
- **jury** (a group of people who decide a verdict in a court case)
- **mob** (an unruly or disorderly crowd of people)
- **orchestra** (a large group of musicians)
- **panel** (a group of experts)
- **staff** (the employees of an organization)
- **team** (a group of players or workers)
- **tribe** (a group of people, often with common ancestry or culture)

**For animals:**

- **colony** (a group of ants, bees, or other social animals)
- **flock** (a group of birds or sheep)
- **herd** (a group of large animals like cows, elephants, or deer)
- **litter** (a group of young animals born at the same time, like puppies or kittens)
- **pack** (a group of wolves or dogs)
- **pride** (a group of lions)
- **school** or **shoal** (a group of fish)
- **swarm** (a large group of insects, especially bees)
- **troop** (a group of monkeys or baboons)

**For things:**

- **bouquet** (a bunch of flowers)
- **bunch** (a cluster of items, like grapes or keys)
- **bundle** (a group of items tied together)
- **collection** (an assembly of items gathered for common characteristics)
- **fleet** (a group of vehicles, ships, or aircraft)
- **forest** or **clump** (a group of trees)
- **galaxy** (a group of stars)
- **library** (a collection of books)
- **pile** (a heap of objects)
- **range** (a chain of mountains)
- **set** (a group of matched or related items)
- **stack** (a neatly arranged pile of items)

The key characteristic of a collective noun is that it treats a collection of individuals as a single unit. For example, "The **team** is playing well" (singular verb) emphasizes the team as a single entity, even though it's made up of many players. However, in British English, it's often acceptable to use a plural verb if the focus is on the individual members of the group (e.g., "The **team** are arguing among themselves").
