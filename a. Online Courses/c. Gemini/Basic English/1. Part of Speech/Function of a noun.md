### Primary Functions of Nouns

1. Subject of a Sentence:
    
    The noun performs the action of the verb. It's usually found at the beginning of a sentence or clause.
    
    - **Dogs** bark loudly. (**Dogs** is the subject)
    - The **teacher** explained the lesson. (**Teacher** is the subject)
2. Object of a Verb:
    
    Nouns can be directly affected by the action of the verb (direct object) or indirectly affected (indirect object).
    
    - **Direct Object:** Receives the action of the verb.
        - She reads a **book**. (**Book** is the direct object)
        - He kicked the **ball**. (**Ball** is the direct object)
    - **Indirect Object:** To whom or for whom the action is done. It usually comes before the direct object.
        - He gave **Mary** a present. (**Mary** is the indirect object; "present" is the direct object)
        - She bought **her brother** a new phone. (**Her brother** is the indirect object)
3. Object of a Preposition:
    
    The noun follows a preposition (like in, on, at, with, to, for, by, etc.) to form a prepositional phrase.
    
    - The cat is **under the table**. (**Table** is the object of the preposition "under")
    - They are talking **about politics**. (**Politics** is the object of the preposition "about")
4. Complement (Predicate Nominative/Subject Complement):
    
    A noun that follows a linking verb (like is, am, are, was, were, seems, becomes) and renames or identifies the subject.
    
    - My father is a **doctor**. (**Doctor** renames "father")
    - She became the **leader**. (**Leader** renames "she")
5. Appositive:
    
    A noun or noun phrase that renames another noun right beside it. It provides additional information about the preceding noun.
    
    - My brother, **a talented artist**, painted this picture. (**A talented artist** renames "brother")
    - We visited Rome, **the Eternal City**. (**The Eternal City** renames "Rome")
6. Adjective (Noun Adjunct):
    
    Sometimes a noun can modify another noun, acting like an adjective.
    
    - **Car** keys (What kind of keys? Car keys)
    - **School** bus (What kind of bus? School bus)
    - **Coffee** cup (What kind of cup? Coffee cup)
