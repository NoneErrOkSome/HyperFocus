### English Nouns Study Guide: Proper, Collective, and Uncountable

This guide covers three important types of nouns and their key characteristics.

---

#### 1. Proper Nouns

- **Definition:** Names a _specific_ person, place, organization, or unique thing.
- **Key Rule:** ALWAYS capitalize proper nouns in English.
- **Function:** Identifies a unique individual entity.
- **Examples:**
    - **People:** John, Mary, Dr. Smith, Queen Elizabeth II
    - **Places:** London, Mount Everest, France, Central Park, The Eiffel Tower
    - **Organizations:** United Nations, Google, Red Cross, Harvard University
    - **Days/Months/Holidays:** Monday, July, Christmas, Easter

#### 2. Collective Nouns

- **Definition:** Refers to a _group_ of people, animals, or things as a _single unit_.
- **Key Idea:** The group acts together as one.
- **Verb Agreement (Crucial Difference!):**
    - **American English (AmE):** Almost always treats collective nouns as **singular**, taking a singular verb.
        - _Example:_ "The **team is** playing well." (The team as one unit)
        - _Example:_ "The **family has** arrived." (The family as one group)
    - **British English (BrE):** Often treats collective nouns as **plural**, taking a plural verb, especially when focusing on the individual members within the group.
        - _Example:_ "The **team are** playing well." (Focus on the individual players)
        - _Example:_ "The **family have** arrived." (Focus on the individuals arriving)
        - _Exception (AmE & BrE):_ "The **police are** investigating." (Always plural for 'police')
- **Examples by Category:**
    - **People:** audience, band, choir, class, committee, crew, crowd, family, jury, mob, orchestra, staff, team, tribe
    - **Animals:** colony (ants), flock (birds/sheep), herd (cows), litter (puppies), pack (wolves), pride (lions), school/shoal (fish), swarm (bees), troop (monkeys)
    - **Things:** bouquet (flowers), bunch (grapes/keys), bundle, collection, fleet (vehicles), forest (trees), galaxy (stars), library (books), pile, set, stack

#### 3. Uncountable Nouns (Mass Nouns / Noncount Nouns)

- **Definition:** Refers to things that cannot be counted individually. They represent substances, concepts, or categories as a whole mass.
- **Key Rules (Think "Cannot count 'one' of them"):**
    1. **No Plural Form:** Do not add "-s" to make them plural (e.g., no "informations," "furnitures").
    2. **Singular Verb:** Always take a singular verb (e.g., "The **information is**...").
    3. **No "a/an":** Cannot be used with indefinite articles "a" or "an" (e.g., no "a water," "an advice").
    4. **Quantifying:** Use specific phrases (partitives) or quantifiers like "some," "much," "a lot of."
        - _Examples:_ a **piece of** advice, a **glass of** water, **some** information, **much** progress.
- **Examples by Category:**
    - **Liquids/Gases:** water, milk, coffee, tea, juice, air, oxygen
    - **Materials/Substances:** wood, metal, glass, paper, gold, sugar, salt, rice, bread, butter
    - **Abstract Ideas/Concepts:**
        - _Emotions/Qualities:_ love, happiness, courage, beauty
        - _Information/Knowledge:_ advice, information, news, knowledge, research, feedback, homework
        - _General:_ time, space, work, fun, luck, traffic, weather, education, health, peace
    - **Categories (as a whole):** furniture, luggage, equipment, clothing, jewellery
    - **Natural Phenomena:** rain, snow, sunshine
- **Dual Nature Nouns (Context Matters!):**
    - Some nouns can be BOTH countable and uncountable depending on the meaning.
        - **Hair:** _Uncountable_ (general) "long hair"; _Countable_ (strands) "three hairs"
        - **Time:** _Uncountable_ (concept) "enough time"; _Countable_ (instances) "a good time"
        - **Paper:** _Uncountable_ (material) "printer paper"; _Countable_ (document/sheet) "two papers" (essays), "a paper" (newspaper)
        - **Coffee:** _Uncountable_ (beverage) "I like coffee"; _Countable_ (cups) "two coffees"
