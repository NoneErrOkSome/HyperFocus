Okay, let's get into the **Passive Voice** in English with as much detail as possible. This is a very useful grammatical structure that changes the focus of a sentence.

**What is Passive Voice?**

At its core, the **passive voice** is a way of constructing a sentence so that the **subject receives the action of the verb**, rather than performing the action.

This is in contrast to the **active voice**, where the subject _performs_ the action.1

- **Active:** The cat (subject) **chased** (verb) the mouse (object).
    - (Here, the cat is doing the chasing.)
- **Passive:** The mouse (subject) **was chased** (verb) by the cat (agent).
    - (Here, the mouse is receiving the action of being chased. The focus shifts to the mouse.)

**Why and When Do We Use Passive Voice?**

The passive voice isn't just a stylistic choice; it serves several important functions:

1. **When the Agent (Doer of the Action) is Unknown:**
    
    - _Example:_ "My car **was stolen** last night." (We don't know who stole it.)
2. **When the Agent is Unimportant or Obvious:**
    
    - _Example:_ "The road **is being repaired**." (It's probably clear that construction workers are doing it; the important thing is the road repair.)
    - _Example:_ "English **is spoken** here." (It's obvious that people speak it.)
3. When the Action or the Recipient of the Action is More Important than the Agent:
    
    This is the most common reason. You want to emphasize the thing or person affected by the action.
    
    - _Example:_ "A new cancer treatment **has been discovered**." (The discovery is more important than who discovered it, in this context.)
    - _Example:_ "The Mona Lisa **was painted** by Leonardo da Vinci." (While da Vinci is important, if the topic is the Mona Lisa, it starts the sentence.)
4. To Create a More Formal, Impersonal, or Objective Tone:
    
    This is common in scientific, technical, academic, or official writing.
    
    - _Example:_ "The samples **were analyzed**, and the results **were recorded**."
5. **To Avoid Assigning Blame or Responsibility Directly:**
    
    - _Example:_ "Mistakes **were made**." (Avoids saying "You made mistakes.")
6. For Sentence Variety or Better Flow:
    
    Sometimes, using the passive voice helps a sentence connect more smoothly with the previous one by putting a known piece of information at the beginning.
    

**How to Form the Passive Voice:**

The basic structure for the passive voice is:

**Subject + appropriate form of the verb "to be" + Past Participle (Verb3) of the main verb (+ by + agent)**

- The **subject** in the passive sentence is the thing or person that _receives_ the action.
- The **verb "to be"** changes its tense (is, are, was, were, will be, has been, etc.) to match the tense of the original active sentence.
- The **Past Participle (Verb3)** is the third principal part of a verb (e.g., `written, seen, broken, built`).
- The **agent** (the original doer of the action) can be included using the preposition `by`, but it's often omitted if it's unknown, unimportant, or obvious.

**Transforming Active to Passive (Step-by-Step):**

Let's take an active sentence: "The company hired **new employees**."

1. **Identify S-V-O:**
    - Subject: The company
    - Verb: hired
    - Object: new employees
2. **The object of the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive sentence:**
    - `New employees` ...
3. **The main verb of the active sentence changes to its past participle (Verb3):**
    - `hired` (past participle is also `hired`)
4. **Add the appropriate form of the auxiliary verb "to be" before the past participle.** The tense of "to be" must match the tense of the main verb in the active sentence ("hired" is Past Simple, so "to be" becomes "was/were"). Since "New employees" is plural, we use "were."
    - `New employees were hired` ...
5. **The subject of the active sentence can be omitted or become the object of the preposition "by":**
    - `New employees were hired.` (Agent omitted)
    - `New employees were hired by the company.` (Agent included)

**Passive Voice in Different Tenses:**

The verb "to be" changes to show the tense:

- **Present Simple Passive:** `am/is/are + past participle`
    - Active: People make these cars in Germany.
    - Passive: These cars **are made** in Germany.
- **Past Simple Passive:** `was/were + past participle`
    - Active: Someone built this house in 1930.
    - Passive: This house **was built** in 1930.
- **Future Simple Passive:** `will be + past participle`
    - Active: They will announce the results tomorrow.
    - Passive: The results **will be announced** tomorrow.
- **Present Continuous Passive:** `am/is/are + being + past participle`
    - Active: The team is currently discussing the strategy.
    - Passive: The strategy **is currently being discussed** by the team.
- **Past Continuous Passive:** `was/were + being + past participle`
    - Active: They were painting the house when I arrived.
    - Passive: The house **was being painted** when I arrived.
- **Present Perfect Passive:** `has/have + been + past participle`
    - Active: They have cleaned all the windows.
    - Passive: All the windows **have been cleaned**.
- **Past Perfect Passive:** `had + been + past participle`
    - Active: Someone had already informed the manager before the meeting.
    - Passive: The manager **had already been informed** before the meeting.
- **Future Perfect Passive:** `will have + been + past participle`
    - Active: They will have completed the project by next year.
    - Passive: The project **will have been completed** by next year.
- **Modals in Passive Voice:** `modal verb + be + past participle`
    - Active: You must finish the report by Friday.
    - Passive: The report **must be finished** by Friday.
    - Active: We can solve this problem.
    - Passive: This problem **can be solved**.
- **Infinitives in Passive Voice:** `to be + past participle`
    - Active: She wants someone to help her.
    - Passive: She wants **to be helped**.
    - Active: There are many things to do.
    - Passive: There are many things **to be done**.
- **Gerunds in Passive Voice:** `being + past participle`
    - Active: I don't like people criticizing me.
    - Passive: I don't like **being criticized**.

**Verbs with Two Objects (Direct and Indirect):**

If an active sentence has both an indirect object (IO) and a direct object (DO), you can often form two different passive sentences:

- Active: My friend (S) gave **me** (IO) **a wonderful gift** (DO).
    1. **Passive (IO becomes subject):** **I** was given a wonderful gift by my friend.
    2. **Passive (DO becomes subject):** **A wonderful gift** was given **to me** by my friend. (Note the preposition "to" is often needed when the DO becomes the subject).

**Verbs That Cannot Usually Be Passive:**

1. **Intransitive Verbs:** These verbs do not take a direct object, so there's no object to become the subject of a passive sentence.
    - _Examples:_ `arrive, die, sleep, happen, occur, go, come, seem, appear, fall, laugh, cry.`
    - _Incorrect:_ "It was arrived by him." / "Happiness was happened."
2. **Some Stative Verbs:** Even if they can take an object, some stative verbs (verbs describing a state rather than an action) sound very unnatural in the passive voice, particularly those indicating possession or a state of being.
    - _Example (possession):_ "He **has** a new car." (Awkward passive: "A new car is had by him.")
    - _Example (state):_ "This dress **fits** you perfectly." (Awkward passive: "You are perfectly fitted by this dress.")

**The "Get" Passive:**

Sometimes, particularly in informal English, `get` is used instead of `be` to form the passive. This often emphasizes the process of change or something happening, sometimes unexpectedly or negatively.

- _Examples:_
    - "He **got hurt** in the accident." (meaning "He was hurt")
    - "My bicycle **got stolen** last week." (meaning "My bicycle was stolen")
    - "They **got married** in June." (meaning "They were married")

In conclusion, the passive voice is a versatile and important structure in English. It allows us to shift focus, be impersonal, and communicate effectively in various contexts by changing who or what is presented as the subject of the sentence. Understanding its formation across different tenses and knowing when to use it appropriately is key to fluent and sophisticated English.
