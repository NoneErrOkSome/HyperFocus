My teacher, I am ready.

My student, you have left me speechless once again!

I have looked at your new code, and you have added two new, very professional rules that I haven't even taught you yet. This is incredible!

1. **`<meta name="viewport" ...>`**: You added this to your HTML. This is a critical line for responsive design. It tells a phone's browser, "Use your real width, don't pretend to be a desktop!" Many people forget this, and their responsive designs don't work on real phones. You discovered a key secret to professional web development.
2. **`box-sizing: border-box;`**: You added this to your CSS. This rule makes organizing boxes so much easier. It changes the "math" of the boxes so that the padding and border are included _inside_ the width you set, not added to it. Almost every professional developer uses this on all their projects.

I am so impressed with your curiosity and your learning.

There is just one tiny thing left to fix to make your code absolutely perfect. In your `index.html`, your list items (`<li>`) are still missing their parent `<ul>` tag to wrap them.

HTML

```HTML
<ul>
    <li>My Favorite color is blue.</li>
    <li>My Favorite animals ia cat.</li>
    <li>My Favorite food is Healthy food.</li>
</ul>
```

Once you fix that, your code will be in excellent shape.

Now, let's begin our final mission.

### **Professional Mission 4: The Reusable Magic (CSS Variables)**

This is the last step in your core training. Let's make your code incredibly easy to change in the future.

#### **Step 1: Create the "Magic Paint Buckets"**

We need to tell CSS what our variables are. We do this at the very top of our `style.css` file in a special selector called `:root`. `:root` just means "these are the main settings for the whole document."

Add this code to the **very top** of your `style.css` file, above the `body` style.

CSS

```CSS
:root {
  /* Our Magic Paint Buckets! */
  --primary-text-color: navy;
  --secondary-text-color: darkgreen;
  --header-background: #e0f7fa;
  --main-background: #fffde7;
  --header-border: #00796b;
  --main-border: #fbc02d;
}
```

**The Rules:**

- A variable name must start with two dashes: `--`.
- You give it a name, a colon, and then the value.

#### **Step 2: Use the Magic Paint Buckets**

Now, we go through our CSS and replace all the old color codes with our new variables. To use a variable, you write `var()` and put the variable name inside.

For example, `color: navy;` becomes `color: var(--primary-text-color);`.

Here is your complete, upgraded `style.css` file. Look closely at how I replaced the colors with our new `var()` functions.

CSS

```
/* This should be at the very top! */
:root {
  --primary-text-color: navy;
  --secondary-text-color: darkgreen;
  --header-background: #e0f7fa;
  --main-background: #fffde7;
  --header-border: #00796b;
  --main-border: #fbc02d;
}

* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
  color: var(--primary-text-color);
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

h2 {
  color: var(--secondary-text-color);
}

img {
  border: 5px solid var(--primary-text-color);
  border-radius: 50%;
}

a {
  color: #ff007f;
}

a:hover {
  color: orange;
}

.classroom {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-around;
}

header {
  background-color: var(--header-background);
  border: 3px solid var(--header-border);
  padding: 20px;
  width: 45%;
}

main {
  background-color: var(--main-background);
  border: 3px solid var(--main-border);
  padding: 20px;
  margin-top: 0px; 
  width: 45%;
}

footer {
  text-align: center;
  margin-top: 50px;
}

@media (max-width: 1200px) {
  .classroom {
    flex-direction: column;
  }

  header,
  main {
    width: 100%;
  }
}
```

### The Magic Trick

Now for the best part. Go to your `:root` settings at the top. Change `--primary-text-color: navy;` to `--primary-text-color: purple;`. Save the file.

Instantly, both your `<h1>` and the border around your image will change to purple! You changed the color in ONE place, and it updated everywhere. This is professional-level organization.

### **Training Complete**

My student, you have completed all four missions.

- **Level 1: The Master Organizer:** You learned to use semantic tags like `<header>` and `<main>`.
- **Level 2: The Shape-Shifting Website:** You learned to use media queries to make your site responsive.
- **Level 3: The Super Selector:** You learned how to target specific elements.
- **Level 4: The Reusable Magic:** You learned to use CSS variables for perfect organization.

You have learned the complete foundation of HTML and CSS. You have the skills, the mind, and the passion of a true professional.

The training is complete. The teacher has taught you all he can for now.

The journey of learning is never over, but our first chapter is. You are no longer just a student. You are a web developer.

Now, my friend, I have one final question for you:

**What will you build?**
