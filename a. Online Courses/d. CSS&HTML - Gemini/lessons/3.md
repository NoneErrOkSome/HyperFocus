That is fantastic to hear! The best feeling in the world is when a confusing subject suddenly becomes clear. It means you are not just memorizing, you are understanding. I am very proud of you.

You are ready. Let's begin our next mission.

### **Professional Mission 2: The Shape-Shifting Website**

**Our Goal:** Have you ever looked at a website on a computer, and then looked at the _same_ website on a phone? A professional website magically changes its shape to look good on both. On a big screen, it might have many columns side-by-side. On a small phone screen, it stacks everything on top of each other so it's easy to read.

This is called **Responsive Design**.

Our mission is to learn the CSS magic spell that makes our website "respond" to the size of the screen.

#### **The Magic Spell: `@media`**

The magic spell we use is called a **Media Query**.

Think of it like this: Your CSS can ask the web browser a question. It asks, **"Hey browser, how wide is your screen right now?"**

If the screen is wide, we do nothing. But if the screen is narrow (like a phone), we can give the browser a special, new set of CSS rules to follow.

The question looks like this in our `style.css` file:

`@media (max-width: 600px) { ... }`

Let's break down that spell:

- `@media` - This is the magic word that starts the question. It means, "Hey CSS, get ready to check the screen!"
- `(max-width: 600px)` - This is the question itself. It means, "Is the screen's width a **maximum** of 600 tiny steps, or in other words, is it 600px **or less**?"
- `{ ... }` - This means, "If the answer to the question is YES, then use all of the new CSS rules I put inside these curly braces."

#### **Mission Task: Making Our Website Respond**

Right now, our website has two columns side-by-side. That looks great on a big screen. But on a small phone screen, they will be too squished and hard to read.

**Our Plan:** When the screen is narrow, we will tell our boxes to stop being side-by-side and stack on top of each other again.

Go to the very **bottom** of your `style.css` file and add this new code:

CSS

```CSS
/* --- THIS IS OUR MAGIC SPELL FOR PHONES --- */

@media (max-width: 600px) {
  
  /* This rule only works on small screens! */
  .classroom {
    /* We change the Teacher's command from 'side-by-side' to 'stack in a column' */
    flex-direction: column;
  }
  
  /* We also need to tell the boxes they can be wider now */
  header, main {
    /* We tell the students they can now use the FULL width of the phone screen */
    width: 100%;
  }

}
```

**What do these new rules mean?**

- `flex-direction: column;`: We are changing the rule for our parent `.classroom` box. We're saying, "Stop arranging your students in a row. Arrange them in a **column** (one on top of the other)."
- `width: 100%;`: Inside the media query, we are overriding our old `width: 45%;` rule. We're telling the `header` and `main` boxes, "Now that you're stacked, you don't need to be skinny anymore. You can take up **100%** of the screen's width."

#### **How to See The Magic Happen**

"But how can I see this on a phone?" Great question! You don't need a phone. Your browser has a secret tool.

1. Open your `my-website.html` file in Chrome or Firefox.
    
2. Right-click anywhere on your beautiful website and choose **Inspect**. A new window full of code will pop up. Don't worry, it's friendly!
    
3. Near the top of the new window, look for a little icon that looks like a tablet and a phone. Click it.
    
4. Your website will now appear in a frame that looks like a phone. Grab the edge of that frame and drag it to make it wider and skinnier.
    
5. **Watch your website!** As soon as the width number at the top goes below 600, your boxes should magically JUMP from being side-by-side to stacked on top of each other!
    

**Mission Complete!**

You have just learned one of the most important skills of a modern web professional. Your website is now a Shape-Shifter, able to look good on any screen, big or small.

You are doing incredible work. When you are ready for your next mission, we will start **Level 3: The Super Selector**. Just say the word.
